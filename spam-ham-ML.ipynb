Bison don\\'t\\nlive this high up.\\' \"\\n\\nKnapp brought the skull to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science,\\nwhere scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a\\nbison–one that died about 340 years ago. \"This was an extraordinary\\ndiscovery,\" says Russ Graham, the museum\\'s chief curator, adding that it\\ncould alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. \"There\\'s\\nprobably a lot more like it yet to be found.\"\\n\\nAnd not just bison. Colorado isn\\'t the only place where glaciers and\\nsnowfields are melting. Decades of unusual warmth in regions from Peru\\nto Alaska–a trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and\\nindustry–have shrunk or thawed many of the world\\'s 70,000 glaciers. As\\nthe ice recedes, a treasure-trove of human and animal artifacts is\\nemerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep\\nfreeze. The fabrics, wood, bone, and DNA-rich tissue found on the mucky\\nfringes of the ice are revising scientists\\' understanding of our\\npredecessors\\' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued.\\n\\n\"It\\'s mind-boggling how many different fields are being advanced through\\nstudying these remains,\" says Johan Reinhard, a high-altitude\\narchaeologist and explorer-in-residence at the National Geographic\\nSociety. Rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered\\nin the Andes of Peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300-year-old \"Ice\\nMan,\" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the Alps in 1991, have\\noffered time capsules of cultural and biological information. Now, as\\nthe ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional\\ntreasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains.\\n\\nVanishing act. The trick is finding such specimens before Mother\\nNature–and looters–take them first. Once uncovered, frozen remains can\\ndeteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. Moreover, they\\'re\\noften so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them\\ndon\\'t even realize they\\'re ancient.\\n\\nThat was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in\\nBritish Columbia, Canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a\\ndead animal. \"It looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,\"\\nrecalls Warren Ward, a teacher from nearby Nelson. \"But when I looked\\ncloser I could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones.\"\\n\\nFiguring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur\\ntrapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a Zip-Loc\\nbag and delivered them to local officials. Archaeologists later exhumed\\nthe fallen hunter\\'s body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what\\nseemed to be a medicine bag. Carbon dating revealed that the hunter\\nlived about 550 years ago. Dubbed Kwaday Dan Ts\\'inchi, or Long Ago\\nPerson Found, by people of the Champagne and Aishihik First Nations (who\\nmay be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the best-preserved human\\nfrom the period ever found in North America.\\n\\nOther findings from melting ice in the neighboring Yukon region could\\nexplain what that long-ago person was doing in the mountains in the\\nfirst place. \"Before this there was no archaeological record of people\\nliving here,\" says Greg Hare, a Yukon government archaeologist. \"Now we\\nsee that this area was very much part of people\\'s seasonal activities.\"\\n\\nLike Ward\\'s discovery, the search began by chance, when Kristin Benedek\\ncaught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband,\\nGerry Kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south\\nYukon. They followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in\\ncaribou dung. \"It was really odd, because I knew there hadn\\'t been\\ncaribou in the area for at least 100 years,\" recalls Kuzyk, then a\\nwildlife biologist with the Yukon government.\\n\\nCaribou cake. Returning a week later, he found \"what looked like a\\npencil with string wrapped around it.\" It turned out to be a\\n4,300-year-old atlatl, or spear thrower. Further investigation of the\\nice patch–and scores of others around the region–revealed icy layer\\ncakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800\\nyears of changing hunting practices.\\n\\nScientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the\\nice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies.\\nHunters followed the game. They returned for centuries and discarded\\nsome equipment in the ice. \"We\\'ve got people hunting with throwing darts\\nup until 1,200 years ago,\" says Hare, who now oversees the research\\nproject. \"Then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about\\n1,300 years ago. And by 1,200 years ago, there\\'s no more throwing\\ndarts.\"\\n\\nNow scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. They\\nare developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where\\nglaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to\\nhave migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in Alaska\\'s Wrangell\\nand St. Elias mountain ranges–the United States\\' most glaciated\\nterrain–and in the Andes. Johan Reinhard thinks the fast- thawing\\nEuropean Alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as\\nthe Ice Man. \"Global warming is providing us high-altitude\\narchaeologists with some fantastic opportunities right now. We\\'re\\nprobably about the only ones happy about it.\"\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

              "  \"So, like many young children, my daughter Tatum (age 21 months) *really*\\nlikes music. She also likes to have control over her environment, and this\\nmeans she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting\\nthe music playing.\\n\\nBy watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design\\nfrom watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market\\nniche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.\\n\\nThe CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but\\ndoesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead\\nrequiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI\\ndisaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the\\nbutton again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever\\nget music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a\\nsurprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again\\nwhen the music doesn't play.\\n\\nFor toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,\\nwithin half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the\\nbutton multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't\\nchange the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you\\npress, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be\\nthe same.\\n\\nThe back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI\\ndisaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle\\nCDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a\\nproblem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,\\nthat edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and\\nwiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but\\nwhich hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it\\nhasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to\\nunderstand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the\\nCD.\\n\\nTatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is\\na mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the\\nplayer into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing\\nthe play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,\\nbut uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and\\nFM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the\\nbinary distinction of music/no music.\\n\\nWhat would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start\\nplaying a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it\\nwould give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.\\nThe other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half\\nthe size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so\\nthere is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.\\nThe play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of\\nthe player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The\\ndevice would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip\\nopen at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It\\nshould be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'\\nwithout affecting the player.\\n\\n- Jim\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"),\n",

But the two new species,\\notiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known\\nnorth of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. \"It\\'s very likely\\nthese weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental\\nplants from Italy,\" said Dr Barclay. \"It looks like they\\'re here to stay.\"\\nHe found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store\\nin 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a\\nmigrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in\\nsouth-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has\\nestablished itself firmly in the same area.\\nApart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and\\ngrape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The\\nsoil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.\\nOne possible explanation for the invaders\\' successful colonisation of\\nBritain is global warming.

              "  'Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to\\njust run Amithlon (or if that wasn\\'t so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!\\n\\nThis is a near-term thing I could look forward to!\\n\\nHowever, an \\'official\\' laptop seems unexciting to me with only\\nthe items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishing\\nthe listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:\\n1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the\\n   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is\\n   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would\\n   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.\\n   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics\\n   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,\\n   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and\\n    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)\\n\\n1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of \\'internet keys\\'\\n    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll\\n    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.\\n\\n1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)\\n    in BIOS, please.\\n\\n2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan\\n   to pull air through it, and if you don\\'t elevate thelaptop off\\n   the desk or table or bed it\\'s on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good\\n  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you\\'ve got an\\n  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)\\n     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs\\n  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display\\n  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion\\n  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)\\n      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative\\n  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle\\n  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally\\n  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them\\n  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides\\n  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little\\n  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep\\n  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) \\n\\n3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the\\n    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to\\n    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but\\n    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified\\n   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the\\n   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with\\n   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides\\n   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted\\n   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.\\n     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,\\n   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see\\n   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of \\'indian red\\' that are great\\n   candidates) base.  \\n      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight\\n    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-\\n    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare\\n    hood) to feed\\n    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent \\n    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.\\n      The logo should be a coloration of a\\n   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew\\n   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/\\n   at first blush.  We\\'ll see what comes out of the contest and\\n   maybe you\\'ll like the mapping MathCAD does of the\\n   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the\\n   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.\\n   MAA.org has more references, I\\'m sure.\\n\\n4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.\\n\\nOther details:\\nUSB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that\\'s unavailable.\\nOptions like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port\\nshould round out the offering.

              "  'The Times\\n\\n September 06, 2002\\n \\n Scissors are a snip for Third World\\n From Richard Owen in Rome\\n \\n \\n \\n IT IS one of the unanswered questions of the past year: what happens to the\\n millions of nail scissors confiscated by airport security officials from\\n passengers\\x92 hand luggage? Most are thrown away or recycled after being seized\\n as part of security measures since September 11. But an enterprising chaplain\\n is sending them to Catholic missionaries for distribution to Third World\\n hospitals and clinics. In theory travellers who have left nail scissors, nail\\n files, corkscrews or manicure sets from their hand luggage can arrange for\\n them to be returned. In practice many just shrug and leave the scissors by the\\n X-ray scanners. \\n \\n Father Arturo Rossini, chaplain of Malpensa airport in Milan, said that\\n scissors were costly or unavailable in many parts of Africa, Asia and Latin\\n America. \\n \\n He told Corriere della Sera that he had \\x93plucked up the courage\\x94 to ask the\\n authorities if he could have the confiscated scissors. With the help of a\\n retired airport policeman, he had packaged 60,000 nail scissors and manicure\\n sets, using the airport chapel as a packing centre. \\n \\n Packages were shipped in aircraft holds to Peru, Brasil, India, Mozambique,\\n Argentina, Zambia and Kenya. \\x93In such countries, what we think of as a\\n personal grooming accessory can be a vital tool.\\x94 \\n \\n The idea has been taken up at other Italian airports. \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the\\nCold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We\\ncelebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation\\nof Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.\\n\\nTragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.\\n\\nEurope has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that\\nHudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed \"progressive\\ntransnationalism\". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist\\nprogressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the\\ndeconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of\\ncitizenship (i.e. a \"global\" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and\\nthe pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the\\nUnited Nations.\\n\\nThe European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the\\npooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there\\nis a European Parliament, the EU\\'s power resides mainly in the unelected\\nEuropean Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits\\nto their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where\\nelected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an\\nappointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,\\nwhose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,\\nthe EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of\\nthe people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired\\nby the EU\\'s political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice\\nregularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member\\ngovernments. This is a step backward in Europe\\'s political development.\\n\\nEuropean criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of\\ncomplaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact\\nthat our republican system of government is not based on proportional\\nrepresentation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise\\nthe fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy\\nis so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear\\n- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere\\nin the world.\\n\\nOn August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK\\'s Independent\\nnewspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be\\nrestrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade\\nor so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it\\nexaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because\\nthe impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of\\nthe US literally fantastic.\\n\\nAt least, for now.\\n\\nDespite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact\\nremains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European\\nintellectual and political elite.\\n\\nThe Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in\\ncheck the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a\\nsystem in Europe, they feel it\\'s valid for the rest of the world. America,\\nhowever, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot\\nunderstand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national\\nsovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it\\ndoes on compliance with international \"norms.\" They view all departures\\nfrom such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal\\nvote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the\\nprocess is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble\\nwith this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,\\nauthoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic\\nsocieties. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.\\n\\nThus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals\\nto join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the\\nliberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its\\ndictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references\\nto the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to\\ncomply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,\\ntherefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a\\ncommitment to\\nconstitutional rights.\\n\\nNone of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or\\ncooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in\\nfavor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while\\ntheir tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a\\npolitical atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably\\nincrease.\\n\\nThat thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the\\nthought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the\\nnew ideology of transnational progressivism.\\n\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------\\nR.

Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses\\nand restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known\\nto be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very\\neffective at forcing dialog.

Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the\\nuser clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't\\nvulnerable.\\n\\nThe fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser\\ncommand to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will\\nneed to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes.

At shopping \\nmalls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front \\nstoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in \\npublic office. While chances are high that we won't know them \\npersonally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and \\nask for our votes.\\n\\nJust as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it \\nhas begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.\\n\\nIn this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State \\nBill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail \\naddresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent \\neach an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.\\n\\nThat day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more \\nexpensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio \\nspots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of \\n35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.\\n\\nHad Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have \\nbeen equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters \\nwould have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones \\nthrough any of those channels.\\n\\nThe response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He \\nwas lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost \\nentirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been \\nrefined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice \\n``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.\\n\\nHis detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but \\nbecause the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign \\nmay have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money \\nin politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication \\nmediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.\\n\\nNo one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be \\nhighly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, \\nit's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different \\nunsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.\\n\\nThe debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress \\nthat would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We \\nbelieve e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or \\nTV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A \\nsimple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of \\nfuture mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be \\ntaken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.\\n\\nWhen a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the \\nInternet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them \\nto perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 \\npercent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail \\naccounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.\\n\\nCandidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the \\nJones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better \\nensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient \\ngroups.\\n\\nBut the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter \\nan e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without \\nopening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage \\nthe sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam \\nadvocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. \\nPolitical candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best \\nthey can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMike McCurry, former press secretary for President Clinton, is CEO of an \\nadvocacy management and communications software company.

I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of\\nIPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.\\n\\nSo, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a\\nsignificant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?\\nIf CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever\\non the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote\\nsites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity\\nin software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.\\n\\n\\n\\nNiall\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\\n\\n\"),\n",

Lupa\\n did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.\\n \\n As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his\\n mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.\\n \\n Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,\\n was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.\\n \\n Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police\\n yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers\\n from video footage.\\n \\n Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as\\n contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact\\n that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.\\n \\n The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on\\n the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade\\n through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.\\n But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.\\n \\n The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary\\n undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last\\n minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not\\n grab their reins.\\n \\n The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'\\n boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend\\n Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.\\n \\n The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles\\n of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of\\n the Assumption of the Virgin.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon\\nproducts derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as\\na replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -\\nthere is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,\\nbut this is to replicate materials that have been previously created \\nmuch more easily within the petrochemical industry.\\n\\nVegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower\\noil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world \\nwar, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from\\nwaste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. \\n\\nJay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as \\npetroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication \\nof the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously\\nbeing developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately \\nmatching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock\\noil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the\\ngap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to \\ncope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.\\n\\nMy big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.\\nRe-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals\\n(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely \\ndifficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the\\npetrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect\\nthat, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,\\njust at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,\\nfor example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.\\n\\nAll we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling\\nlike pig farms and fish and chip shops...\\n\\nRobin Hill, STEAMY BESS, Brough, East Yorkshire\\n\\n\\n\\n********************************************************************\\nThis email and any attachments are confidential to the intended\\nrecipient and may also be privileged.

It stretches\\n   and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable\\n   than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!\\n\\n5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body\\n   endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and\\n   leaving you with a feeling of well-being.\\n\\n6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually\\n   active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called\\n   pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!\\n\\n7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE\\n   EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.\\n\\n8.

              "  'One of the most bizarre pages I\\'ve seen on the Web. At first I thought it\\nmight be some sort of back-story to a RPG, but, nope, it looks like somebody\\nbelieves this.\\n\\n===\\nhttp://www.viking-z.org/r20i.htm\\n\\nM09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.\\nDINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on\\ntheir hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in\\nRemote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked\\ntogether and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid\\nderivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.\\nThe Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities\\nwith little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a\\ndescription of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see\\nthem. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but\\nnot the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth\\neven if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a\\nrenal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.\\nThe definitive work on dragons is \"The Flight of Dragons\" by Peter\\nDickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long\\nbow. Targets do not come much bigger.\\n\\nTruth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer\\'s current scenario is that\\nthere were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard\\ntheir eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They\\nsurvived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.\\nThey evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet\\n(for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves\\nbut otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.\\n\\nThus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the\\ndinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also\\nto appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote\\nviewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are\\ncontagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be\\nencouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and\\nmind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help\\nso called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great\\ndifficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people\\'s dinosaurs should remove\\nall perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of\\nSatanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus\\nif we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of\\nall other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their\\npsi.\\n\\nTHE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to\\nhold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.\\n\\nDinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of\\nrotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young\\nhatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made\\nthem very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to\\nkeep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this\\nthey had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an\\nact of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the\\nability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and\\nso their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have\\nbecome the source of all Satans, devils and demons.\\n\\nBirds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep\\nthem warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and\\nonly starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend\\nto hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is\\nprimarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not\\nsuitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.\\nAntarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,\\neven if they are standing on ice.\\n\\nMammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act\\nof love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female\\ncan not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird\\nsitting on a nest.\\n\\nDinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,\\nwhile birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate\\nall enemies of their young, but this is secondary.\\n\\nIf one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then\\npurge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our\\nreligions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,\\nregardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to\\nconcentrate on \"How to Brainwash your Neighbour\". Conscious thought has\\nbuilt many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using\\n\"How to care for and protect one\\'s young\" as a foundation.\\n\\nThus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something \"A load of\\ndinosaur\\'s eggs\". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur\\'s eggs of any entity\\ntends to purge all malice back to its roots.\\n\\nIt looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,\\naided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on\\nvampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the\\nserenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.\\n\\nITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take\\ncontrol or ownership of the target\\'s psi and pleasure centres. Check for the\\nfollowing.\\n\\nNest of dinosaur\\'s eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.\\nEggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing\\nhormones, abilities, etc.\\nMind machines.\\nThe original engraving or engram.\\nGOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T\\nhey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the\\nfirst job holders.\\nTIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of\\ntime.\\n\\nMy, our, Man\\'s timetracks, etc.\\nThe time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic\\nSubconscious, etc.\\nEXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.\\nTheir virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever\\none hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the\\nhigher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or\\nother basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.\\nEvery extinct race, etc.\\nBLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via\\ngenetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.\\nEvery blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

              "  '> Bottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have \\n> endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he \\n> ever coined it.\\n\\nAn interesting link courtesy of the Harrow Report: there\\'s no written \\nevidence so far that Senator Everett Dirksen is the source of the \\ninfamous quote attributed to him. It\\'s kind of astounding that there is \\nenough general social consensus (25% of all queries makes it a *very* \\nFAQ) and \"eyewitness\" reporting without a single written source. What \\nthe essay below doesn\\'t seem to answer, though, is what the earliest \\nattributed quote in print by any other writer is. I\\'d naturally be much \\nmore skeptical if the \"quote\" emerged after his death... RK\\n\\n===============================================================\\nhttp://www.dirksencenter.org/featuresBillionHere.htm\\n\\n\"A billion here, a billion there . . .\"\\n\\nDid Dirksen ever say, \" A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon \\nyou\\'re talking real money\"? (or anything very close to that?)\\n\\nPerhaps not. Based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio \\nrecords of The Dirksen Congressional Center, staffers there have found \\nno evidence that Dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to \\nhim.\\n\\nArchivists undertook the search after studying research statistics \\nshowing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote \\nor its variations.\\n\\nHere is what they examined: all of the existing audio tapes of the famed \\n\"Ev and Charlie\" and \"Ev and Jerry\" shows, all newspapers clippings in \\nthe Dirksen Papers, about 12,500 pages of Dirksen\\'s own speech notes, \\ntranscripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of \\nRepublican leadership press conferences, and Dirksen\\'s statements on the \\nSenate floor as documented in the Congressional Record.\\n\\nAlthough Dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to \\nrely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular \\nturn of phrase. For example, in referring to the public debt or \\nexcessive government spending, Dirksen would jot the word \"pothole\" to \\nremind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to \\nthe debt ceiling:\\n\\n\\n\"As I think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make \\nthe deeper we go into the hole, I am reminded of a group of men who were \\nworking on a street. They had dug quite a number of holes. When they got \\nthrough, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to \\nthe hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic \\nhazard.\\n\\n\"Not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a \\nconference. After a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and \\nsaid, ‘I have it. I know how we will get rid of that overriding earth \\nand remove the hazard. We will just dig the hole deeper.\\'\" \\n[Congressional Record, June 16, 1965, p. 13884].\\n\\n\\nOn the same occasion, Dirksen relied on yet another \"spending\" story, \\none he labeled \"cat in the well\":\\n\\n\\n\"One time in the House of Representatives [a colleague] told me a story \\nabout a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. He said, ‘Johnny, a cat \\nfell in a well 100 feet deep. Suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and \\nthen fell back 2 feet. How long would it take the cat to get out of the \\nwell?\\'\\n\\n\"Johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a \\nwhile, and then when the teacher came down and said, ‘How are you \\ngetting along?\\' Johnny said, ‘Teacher, if you give me another slate and \\na couple of slate pencils, I am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes \\nI can land that cat in hell.\\'\\n\\n\"If some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, I do \\nnot find much to cheer about concerning it.\" [Congressional Record, June \\n16, 1965, p. 13884].\\n\\n\\nBut there are no such reminders for the \"A billion here, a billion \\nthere . . . \" tag line as there surely should have been given Dirksen\\'s \\nnote-making tendencies. He spoke often and passionately about the debt \\nceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. Yet there is no \\nauthoritative reference to the \"billion\" phrase.\\n\\nThe chief evidence in support of Dirksen making the statement comes from \\npeople who claim to have heard him. The Library of Congress, for \\nexample, cites someone\\'s personal observation on the campaign trail as \\nevidence. The Dirksen Center has received calls from people who heard \\nDirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. But \\ncross-checking that information with the records has, so far, turned up \\nnothing in the way of confirmation.\\n\\nThe closest documented statement came at a joint Senate-House Republican \\nleadership press conference on March 8, 1962, when Dirksen said, \"The \\nfavorite sum of money is $1 billion – a billion a year for a fatter \\nfederal payroll, a billion here, a billion there.\" [EMD Papers, \\nRepublican Congressional Leadership File, f. 25] But the \"and pretty \\nsoon you\\'re talking real money\" is missing.\\n\\nIn another close call, the New York Times, January 23, 1961, quoted \\nDirksen: \"Look at education – two-and-one-half billion – a billion for \\nthis, a billion for that, a billion for something else. Three to five \\nbillion for public works. You haven\\'t got any budget balance left. \\nYou\\'ll be deeply in the red.\" [Cited in Byron Hulsey\\'s \"Everett Dirksen \\nand the Modern Presidents,\" Ph.D. dissertation (May 1998, University of \\nTexas, p. 226]\\n\\nOf course, the Dirksen Papers do not document completely the late \\nSenator\\'s comments. For example, The Center that bears his name does not \\nhave his testimony before committees. Their collection of Congressional \\nRecords ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of Dirksen\\'s life and \\ncareer – he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses \\nclaim he said it throughout his career. Dirksen\\'s campaign speeches \\ntended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated \\nnewspaper accounts. Dirksen also held center stage before the video age, \\nmeaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped \\ncapture.\\n\\nBottom line: the late Senate Minority Leader certainly would have \\nendorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he \\never coined it.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n---\\nMy permanent email address is khare@alumni.caltech.edu\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Just imagine if the anonymous noise injected into our world newsphere (noosphere?) was, say, a fraudulent story that a stock accounting scandal had been accused and the evildoers were shorting. \\n\\nOh, wait, that happened. An unemployed Orange County student took down Emulex...\\n\\nEnjoy!\\n  Rohit\\n\\nkhare@alumni.caltech.edu\\n\\n\\nStop Those Presses! Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All\\n\\nOctober 2, 2002\\nBy LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nApparently it fell into the category \"too good to check.\"\\n\\n\\nLast Friday, several British newspapers reported that the\\nWorld Health Organization had found in a study that blonds\\nwould become extinct within 200 years, because blondness\\nwas caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The\\nreports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News\\nprogram \"Good Morning America,\" and on Saturday by CNN. \\n\\nThere was only one problem, the health organization said in\\na statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds\\nwould become extinct, and it had never done a study on the\\nsubject. \\n\\n\"W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports\\noriginated,\" said the organization, an agency of the United\\nNations based in Geneva, \"but would like to stress that we\\nhave no opinion of the future existence of blonds.\" \\n\\nAll the news reports, in Britain and the United States,\\ncited a study from the World Health Organization - \"a\\nblonde-shell study,\" as The Daily Star of London put it.\\nBut none reported any scientific details from the study or\\nthe names of the scientists who conducted it. \\n\\nOn \"Good Morning America,\" Charles Gibson began a\\nconversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:\\n\"There\\'s a study from the World Health Organization, this\\nis for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women\\nand men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural\\nblonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth\\nwithin 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as\\nbrunets.\" \\n\\nMs. Sawyer said she was \"somewhat of a natural blonde.\"\\n\\n\\nJeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the\\nanchors got the information from an ABC producer in London\\nwho said he had read it in a British newspaper. \\n\\nIn London, The Sun and The Express both reported that\\nunnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in\\nScandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected\\nthe last true blond to hail from Finland. \\n\\nThe British accounts were replete with the views of\\nbleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow\\nblondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare\\ngenes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an\\nendangered species. \\n\\nJournalists in London said last night that the source of\\nthe reports was probably one of several European news\\nagencies that are used by the British press, but it\\nremained unclear which one. \\n\\nTim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the\\nreport was probably distributed by The Press Association,\\nBritain\\'s domestic news agency. \"Several papers picked it\\nup,\" he said. \\n\\nBut Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press\\nAssociation, said that although it had considered running\\nthe report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking\\nto the World Health Organization. \\n\\n\"We didn\\'t do that story because we made an inquiry to the\\nWorld Health Organization first,\" she said. \"They told us\\nthat report was two years old, and had been covered at the\\ntime. They said it had been picked up again that day by a\\nGerman news agency.\" \\n\\nShe added that she did not know which agency the\\norganization was referring to. \\n\\nDr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California\\nat San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for\\nblond hair \"sounds patently incorrect.\"\\n\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/02/health/02BLON.html?ex=1034599071&ei=1&en=3a0e4f0b2b251593\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

This -is- a First Amendment issue.\\nPublic streets, provided one isn\\'t blocking traffic, generally tend to\\nbe sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few\\nyears ago (I\\'ll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have\\nchanged, and the specific facts in this case are weak).    IF this guy\\n_was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all the\\npro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong.  He certainly didn\\'t do enough\\nof a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge.\\n\\nI\\'ll play with your perspective though.   Lets assume a few things.\\nIf I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably\\nassemble against Bush, do you think they\\'ll give me a permit?\\nProbably not.   So I lie.   Then the cop does what happened in this\\nscenario.  HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I\\nfalsified my statement to get this said document.   He arrests me.\\nEnd of story.\\n\\nGAB> The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied\\nGAB> nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting\\nGAB> political rallies that you don\\'t agree with has become\\nGAB> common practice.

Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to\\nchose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting\\ndown has grown to become the answer because the government, over a\\nspan of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the\\nrights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.    If you\\nquestion the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in\\ngeneral, you\\'re aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of\\nthe folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you\\'re an\\nanarchist, and you\\'re herded off to a \\'designated protest spot\\' miles\\naway from anything.

It was an \\nexplicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.\\n    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one.

Hoover\\'s South Boston \"social-club\"\\nputsch, starting in the mid 1960\\'s, was particularly audacious in\\nhindsight.

Same stuff, different century, with\\napparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on\\nthe gears of \"justice\" like so much hamburger.\\n\\nHowever, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was\\n\"greasing\", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could\\nlove: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence --\\non paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door,\\nbut still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken\\'s famous \"bluenoses\\nand busybodies\".\\n\\n\\nIt all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of\\nbeginnings. What she couldn\\'t do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy\\nthen tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a\\nsmaller, \"manageable\" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more\\nheads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition,\\nin more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.\\n\\nEvery time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or\\nharmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now,\\napparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing\\nhappened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead\\nyears. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely\\nlucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently\\nscale newly-legislated \"barriers to competition\" imposed on them by\\nthe state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of\\nthose substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of\\nevil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly\\ncoercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred\\nliberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.\\n\\nAs Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don\\'t need\\ngovernment if nobody\\'s breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to\\nParkinson\\'s Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people,\\nbreaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they\\nconfiscate at tax time.\\n\\nAnd, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably\\necho here his father Milton\\'s famous observation that government\\nregulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and\\nnever the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even,\\n*especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in\\nthe increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our\\ngovernment now imposes on us.\\n\\n\\nAnd there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati.\\n\\nIn fact, Hayek himself, in \"The Road to Serfdom\", couldn\\'t have\\npredicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover\\'s blatant\\nimposition, \"for our own good\", of Vietnam-era statist power at the\\nneighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn\\'t have had\\nbetter \"useful idiots\" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an\\nabsolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover.\\n\\nUseful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who\\nwere eating out of Hoover\\'s power-craven hand for the entire middle\\nof the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger\\'s hand, whether they knew it\\nor not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you\\'ll notice, which\\nsaw the increasingly steady imposition of \"mob\" violence, and market\\ncontrol, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the\\nimaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting,\\nmovie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little\\nCaesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now\\nstrictly political, descendents.\\n\\nIn terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr.\\nSalvati and the others, dead or alive, as a \"transfer-price\", in\\nhuman lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style\\nVietnam-era Keynesian \"social-cost\" input-output accounting at its\\nmost despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that\\nwas committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic\\ncontrol, in the name of what really was, as you\\'ll now agree, just a\\nrace war between thugs up in Boston.\\n\\n\\nThis shouldn\\'t be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least\\nfought by thugs, though they\\'re usually conceived elsewhere, and\\nendorsed, at the time, by all the \"right\" people, for all the \"right\"\\nreasons.\\n\\nAs far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson\\'s observation\\nthat a \"prince\" is just a stationary bandit.\\n\\nThough, given his penchant for women\\'s clothing, for other men, and,\\nwhat\\'s actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of\\npeople of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J.\\nEdgar Hoover a bandit \"princess\", instead.\\n\\n\"Bandit Queen\", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens --\\nand real bandits -- everywhere.\\n\\nCheers,\\nRAH\\n- ---------\\n\\n\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/national/25FBI.html?todaysheadlines=\\n&pagewanted=print&position=top\\n\\n\\nThe New York Times\\nAugust 25, 2002\\nHoover\\'s F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX\\nBUTTERFIELD\\n\\nBOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar\\nHoover\\'s war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional\\ninvestigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of\\nNew England\\'s organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca.\\n\\nTwo gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr.\\nPatriarca\\'s permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan,\\n\"as they were having a problem with him,\" according to an F.B.I. log\\nof the conversation. \"Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,\" the\\nF.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an\\nalley, shot six times.\\n\\nIt was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of\\nInvestigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known\\ngangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England\\nMafia was involved.\\n\\nBut when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real\\nkillers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were\\nleft alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to\\ndeath or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing\\nto do with it.\\n\\nOne, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with\\nthe Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I.\\nfor $300 million for false imprisonment.\\n\\nHis is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the\\nJustice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled,\\ncorrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.\\'s Boston\\noffice in its effort to bring down the mob.\\n\\nThe lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years\\nin a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of\\nthe most explosive evidence has only recently come to light,\\nincluding documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca\\napproved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation\\nby the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the\\ndepartment into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston.\\n\\nThe documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently\\nincluding Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents\\nwere employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were\\nprotecting them from prosecution.\\n\\n\"J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal\\nhimself,\" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati\\'s lawyer. \"He allowed a\\nwitness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect\\none of his informants.\"\\n\\nMr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and\\nmay have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark\\nwho worked for Mr. Barboza.\\n\\nAsked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr.\\nSalvati\\'s innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a\\nspokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the\\npending litigation.\\n\\nA Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate\\nmisconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the\\ninvestigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting\\nsentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and\\nobstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were\\nF.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and\\nStephen Flemmi are brothers.\\n\\nThe Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton,\\nRepublican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston\\noffice to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau\\'s knowledge\\nthat Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr.\\nDeegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime,\\nincluding who fired the first shot.\\n\\nThen, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover\\'s office demanded to know what\\nprogress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer.\\n\\nIn a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston\\noffice said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot\\nwounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca \"potentially\\ncould be an excellent informant.\"\\n\\nThe agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have\\nkilled seven men, \"and, from all indications, he is going to continue\\nto commit murder.\" Nevertheless, the agent said, \"the informant\\'s\\npotential outweighs the risk involved.\"\\n\\nA Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. \"The most\\nfrightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi\\'s murders,\\nthe director does not even respond,\" the investigator said. \"There is\\nno message not to use a murderer as a government informant.\"\\n\\nThe origin of the corruption scandal was public and political\\npressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing\\npower of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I.\\nagents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties\\nto a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr.\\nBulger.\\n\\nBoth sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and\\nthe trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually\\nhelped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled\\norganized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger\\'s gang was able to take\\nover the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while\\nthe F.B.I. looked the other way.\\n\\nOne reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr.\\nPatriarca\\'s involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional\\ninvestigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device\\nin his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who\\ntranscribed the conversation made it appear that the information was\\ncoming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device,\\nthe investigators say.\\n\\nMr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted\\nin 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on\\nparole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state\\njudge after the Justice Department task force made public documents\\nsuggesting his innocence.\\n\\nTwo of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their\\nsurvivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million\\nlawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to\\ndie in the electric chair. His life was spared only when\\nMassachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974.\\n\\nMr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston\\'s North End with\\nhis wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30\\nyears. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put\\non the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each\\nother.\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: PGP 7.5\\n\\niQA/AwUBPWmB2sPxH8jf3ohaEQL9qgCgxHq0ee06UEsNv8u8wgvmjf9K7S4An3Rb\\n3srsGomWjNDwIaKoEHOfNHpI\\n=OELD\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------\\nR.

The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), \\nand the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. \\n\\nI can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not \\nthe most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the \\ndatabase, but the database is accessible from the web application. \\nAssuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the \\ndatabase password, I can use a different database with different \\nuser... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.\\n\\nWhere I can found good documentation about this topic?\\n\\nThere is another approach that I would share with the list, something I \\nthought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. \\nAfter all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to \\nlearn methods and technics.\\n\\nFirst of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so \\nI have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach \\ncould be using a small java bean application that run as normal user \\n(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the \\nnobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory \\nor a place where it can hold passwords and keys.\\n\\nThe web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in \\nthe init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small \\nbean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source \\nis the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the \\ndb connection/password to the main web application.\\n\\nIn this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in \\nshared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user \\naccount to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your \\nprovider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java \\napplication (that means, really, another server running in the \\nbackground).\\n\\nAny suggestions?\\n\\nThank you,\\nMario Torre\\n-- \\nPlease avoid sending me Word or PowerPoint attachments.\\nSee http://www.fsf.org/philosophy/no-word-attachments.html \\n\\n\"),\n",

The MaXLine family features two critical differentiators: \\nhuge capacities up to 320 GB for corporate archiving and media recording; \\nand unique manufacturing and quality for 24/7 operations with mean time to \\nfailure (MTTF) rates exceeding one million hours.\\n\\nThe MaXLine family is designed to bring hard disk drives into \"near-line\" \\narchive applications. By adding a layer of MaXLine drives to archive \\narchitectures, companies can instantly recover time-critical data including \\nexecutive e-mail, transaction data and accounting data that may need to be \\nrecovered on demand.\\n\\nThese new drives are designed to solve another enterprise problem with the \\nstorage of video, media and audio conference call files. Even compressed, \\nthese files take up tremendous amounts of high-cost server space. Priced \\nstarting around $299.95 to $399.95 MSRP, Maxtor\\'s MaXLine family offers \\nhigh capacity drives for enterprise applications at price points between \\ntraditional ATA and SCSI drives.\\n\\nFor system OEMs and white box builders, MaXLine offers high-density, \\neasy-to-integrate storage for use in entry-level and mid-size server \\nenvironments.\\n\\n\"The demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies \\nare meeting their obligations to quickly access executive e-mails, \\nfinancial documents and transaction records,\" said Mike Dooley, senior \\ndirector of marketing for the Desktop Products Group at Maxtor. \"Users may \\nnot need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but \\nwhen they do need access, it must be instant. Recent advances in ATA \\ntechnology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our \\nlegacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ATA \\nhard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these \\nenterprise applications.\"\\n\\nThe MaXLine family includes the 5400-RPM MaXLine II, designed for \\ncapacities up to 320 GB and the 7200-RPM MaXLine Plus II, designed for \\ncapacities up to 250 GB. At these capacities, MaXLine offers higher storage \\ndensity than many tape and optical solutions. These drives have also been \\ntested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, \\nalready exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust Maxtor designs, \\nwhich exceed MTTF of over one million hours.

              "  'I did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years\\nago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don\\'t\\nrecall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image\\nof some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is\\nintrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is\\nnot graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary\\nif you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.\\nThere have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the\\nearly 1980s if not before.\\n\\nA generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement\\nsnapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information\\nmust (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you\\nwrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly\\nadequate.\\n\\nIt does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed\\nand what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)\\nmust not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,\\nor to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS\\nlives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments.

Those at least do\\nnot have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and\\nthere is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk\\nmay hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault\\nrecovery\\nand lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?\\n\\nGlenn Everhart\\n\\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: bmord@icon-nicholson.com [mailto:bmord@icon-nicholson.com]\\nSent: Tuesday, September 03, 2002 3:04 PM\\nTo: Webappsec Securityfocus.Com; SECPROG Securityfocus\\nSubject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from\\nattacks\\n\\n\\nHi,\\n\\nI was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a\\nbase disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base\\nimage is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes\\nchanges to its own \"redo\" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance\\nincorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the\\ncurrent disk image for that specific virtual machine.\\n\\nThis is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the\\nhoneypots mailing list)\\nhttp://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html\\n\\nCould this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server\\napplications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,\\neven before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.\\n\\nThe physical architectures of most production client/server systems are\\nlayered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server\\nrunning Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net\\nbusiness logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one\\nof these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database\\nserver, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one\\npartition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the\\npartition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from\\none boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap\\nspace, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.\\n\\nWhen someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that\\nshouldn\\'t be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or\\nApache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But\\nwhat if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a \"delta\" or\\n\"redo\" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the\\nredo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be\\nminimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from\\nbackup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high\\navailability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is\\nalways accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at\\nthe same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater\\nperformance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be\\napplied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions\\n(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)\\n\\nDoes anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept\\nbeen discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don\\'t yet know?\\nI use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in\\nthis post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server\\nsystems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and\\nnon-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly\\nghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or\\nno) downtime.\\n\\nThanks for any opinions,\\nBen\\n\\n\\n**********************************************************************\\nThis transmission may contain information that is privileged, confidential and/or exempt from disclosure under applicable law.

It\\'s just that KnowNow is waaay to small of a part of their $7.2B portfolio... so far!\\n\\nRohit\\n\\nkhare@alumni.caltech.edu\\n\\n\\nTexas Pacific Goes Where Others Fear to Spend\\n\\nAugust 25, 2002\\nBy RIVA D. ATLAS and EDWARD WONG \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIt was one of the first calls David N. Siegel placed when\\nhe became chief executive of the beleaguered US Airways\\nlast March. Seeking advice on how to hammer out a leaner\\nand meaner business plan, keep his planes flying and\\nrenegotiate costly contracts with the unions, he flipped\\nthrough his files and found the number for the Texas\\nPacific Group, an investment firm headed by David\\nBonderman, a former civil rights lawyer with a reputation\\nfor fixing problem companies. \\n\\nMr. Siegel, once a top executive at Continental Airlines,\\nhad watched Texas Pacific\\'s partners turn an investment of\\n$66 million in the airline, made three years after it filed\\nfor bankruptcy in 1990, into a profit of more than $600\\nmillion. And they had made nearly as much on their stake in\\nAmerica West, which filed for bankruptcy in 1992. \\n\\nThat search for advice turned into an offer. Why not let\\nTexas Pacific have a role in US Airways\\' revival? asked\\nRichard Schifter, the Texas Pacific executive whom Mr.\\nSiegel reached. \\n\\nIn June, Mr. Siegel called Mr. Schifter again. And days\\nbefore US Airways announced its plans to file for\\nbankruptcy two weeks ago - but after it had negotiated\\nabout $550 million in concessions with its unions - Texas\\nPacific, based in Fort Worth and San Francisco, agreed to\\nkick in $100 million as part of a $500 million loan to keep\\nthe company operating during bankruptcy. It also agreed to\\nbuy $200 million of stock, or 38 percent of the company,\\nand take 5 of 13 seats on the board if US Airways emerges\\nfrom bankruptcy - unless another investor surfaces with a\\nbetter offer. \\n\\n\"One of the reasons we were interested is few other folks\\nwere,\" said James Coulter, a partner at Texas Pacific, in\\nan interview after the bankruptcy filing. \"There aren\\'t\\nmany people around with the stomach or the knowledge to\\ndelve into the airline industry.\" \\n\\nTexas Pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying\\nbusinesses no one else wants. Mr. Coulter and Mr. Bonderman\\nmade their names during the recession of the early 1990\\'s\\nwith investments in Continental and America West. The\\nfirm\\'s hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping\\ncompanies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its\\nextensive network of contacts for talented replacements. \\n\\nNow the partners are again looking for trouble. In the last\\nyear alone, Texas Pacific has announced or completed six\\nacquisitions, most in unloved industries like\\nsemiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. Just last month,\\nit announced plans to buy Burger King, which has been\\nlosing market share, for $2.26 billion. It is also bidding\\nfor Bankgesellschaft Berlin, a large and troubled bank. \\n\\nThe most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these\\ndeals could be Texas Pacific\\'s acquisition last November of\\nMEMC Electronic Materials, a semiconductor company, for $6\\n- yes, just $6 - in cash. It will also guarantee a $150\\nmillion bank loan. \\n\\nIn the last few years, most firms that specialize in\\nleveraged buyouts - the use of junk bonds, bank loans and\\nother borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies -\\nhave been largely inactive. Falling stock prices have made\\nmanagements reluctant to sell cheaply. Companies that are\\nfor sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. \\n\\nTexas Pacific is different. \"This is a terrific environment\\nfor them,\" said Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive of the\\nBlackstone Group, which also specializes in buyouts. \\n\\nMark Attanasio, a managing director at Trust Company of the\\nWest, which has invested with Texas Pacific, said: \"Most\\nother buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing.\\nYou don\\'t see many guys wanting to take on operational\\nfixes.\" \\n\\nLike most other buyout firms, Texas Pacific tries to keep\\nits inner workings private: its partners rarely grant\\ninterviews and its Web site is perpetually under\\nconstruction. Mr. Bonderman, Mr. Coulter and William Price,\\nthe third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for\\nthis article. \\n\\nMr. Bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and\\nbright, patterned socks. \"He likes argyle socks, and they\\ntend to fall down around his ankles,\" said Henry Miller, an\\ninvestment banker who advises troubled companies. Early in\\nhis career, when he was a Washington lawyer, Mr. Bonderman\\nargued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. \\n\\nWhen a Texas Pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known\\nfor obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking\\nin places like Pakistan, Nepal and, most recently, Bhutan.\\n\"Whenever I see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on\\nmy caller I.D., I know it\\'s David calling,\" said one\\ninvestment banker who often works with Mr. Bonderman. \\n\\nMr. Bonderman made his reputation in the 1980\\'s as the\\nchief investment officer for Robert Bass, the Texas oilman.\\nMr. Bonderman enriched Mr. Bass a second time by making\\nearly bets in industries like cable television and taking\\nstakes in troubled companies like American Savings & Loan,\\nwhich had been seized by the government. Over nearly a\\ndecade, Mr. Bonderman\\'s picks earned an average annual\\nreturn of 63 percent for Mr. Bass. \\n\\nIn 1993, Mr. Bonderman struck out on his own with Mr.\\nCoulter, a former Lehman Brothers banker who had also\\nworked for Mr. Bass. They teamed up later that year with\\nMr. Price, a veteran of GE Capital Capital and Bain &\\nCompany, a consulting firm, to form Texas Pacific. \\n\\nThe three men have complementary skills, investment bankers\\nand other deal makers said. Mr. Bonderman is the master\\nstrategist and Mr. Coulter is good at structuring deals and\\nthe detailed management of the firm\\'s purchases. Mr. Price\\noften recruits managers and advises on operational issues. \\n\\n\"David is very much the optimist, very much the deal\\nmaker,\" said Greg Brenneman, a former president of\\nContinental. \"Jim is very much a counterbalance to David.\\nHe will sit back and ask the tough questions. He will\\napproach investments a little bit more skeptically than\\nDavid does.\" \\n\\nBy the end of the 1990\\'s, Texas Pacific was well\\nestablished in deal making. It easily raised $4.5 billion\\nfrom pension funds and other investors in early 2000. To\\ncelebrate their war chest, the firm\\'s partners rented San\\nFrancisco\\'s City Hall and hired the B-52\\'s to play at a\\nparty. \\n\\nBut as the stock market began to tumble, Texas Pacific\\nhesitated. For a 17-month stretch, the partners made no\\ndeals. They checked out some of the biggest corporate\\nblowups, including Adelphia, Xerox and Global Crossing, but\\nstayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the\\nbusinesses untenable. \\n\\nInstead, Texas Pacific began to hastily exit some existing\\ninvestments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during\\nthat stretch. \\n\\n\"They started to cash out early in the cycle,\" said Mario\\nGiannini, chief executive of Hamilton Lane, a money\\nmanagement firm, some of whose clients are Texas Pacific\\ninvestors. \\n\\nThe good times of the late 1990\\'s were not ideal for Texas\\nPacific - it struggled to find downtrodden companies that\\nneeded its help. \\n\\nBut Texas Pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the\\nrough. It revived Oxford Health Plans, the health\\nmaintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the\\nmid-1990\\'s, almost doubling its money after bringing in new\\nmanagers and upgrading computer systems. In 1996, it made a\\n$280 million investment in Ducati Motor, the Italian\\nmotorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than\\nquadrupled. \\n\\nBut Texas Pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at\\nthe top of the market. Texas Pacific\\'s $560 million\\ninvestment in the J. Crew Group, the clothing retailer, for\\nwhich it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997,\\nhas been a disappointment. So has its 1999 purchase of\\nBally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand\\nfor luxury goods. \\n\\nTexas Pacific also lost more than $100 million on Zilog, a\\nsemiconductor company, and Favorite Brands, a candy maker,\\nboth of which filed for bankruptcy. \\n\\nSome of these investments have taken a toll on the firm\\'s\\nperformance. Texas Pacific is still selling off holdings in\\ntwo investment funds it raised over the last decade. The\\nfirst fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and\\nincluding investments made through March 1997, should\\nreturn more than 40 percent, according to one Texas Pacific\\ninvestor. But its second fund - $2.5 billion raised in 1997\\n- could return less than half that, this investor\\nestimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on\\nthese investments before the stock market sank. \\n\\nBut because Texas Pacific has not sold many of its holdings\\nin the second fund, profits on these investments could\\nrebound. It is hoping, for example, that with new\\nmanagement in place, J. Crew will turn around as the\\neconomy rebounds. In any case, one competitor said, \"their\\nreturns look pretty good when you consider that some other\\nfunds won\\'t return any capital\" to investors. \\n\\nBut with the weak economy throwing many companies into\\ntrouble, Texas Pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier\\nsuccess, the investor said. \"They should do exceptionally\\nwell,\" he said. \\n\\nTexas Pacific has a distinct style - if not formula. It\\nrelies on talented, self-sufficient managers to restructure\\ntroubled companies, preferring to remain hands-off, except\\nfor surveillance from the boardroom. When necessary, it\\nreplaces managers. \\n\\nLess than a year after Continental emerged from bankruptcy,\\nfor example, Mr. Bonderman watched with frustration as his\\nold friend Robert R. Ferguson, the chief executive, led it\\nto the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. \\n\\nContinental\\'s board, where Mr. Bonderman was chairman, then\\nbrought in Gordon M. Bethune, an executive at Boeing, and\\nin October 1994 he replaced Mr. Ferguson as chief\\nexecutive. Mr. Bethune quickly did a top-to-bottom overhaul\\nof the company and is now considered a great turnaround\\nartist of the industry. \\n\\n\"The biggest conflict I\\'ve ever seen was with Bob\\nFerguson,\" said Clark Onstad, a former general counsel for\\nthe Federal Aviation Administration, in describing the\\nthinking of Mr. Bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982\\nBraniff bankruptcy. \"He chose Bethune over his longtime\\nfriend Ferguson because he thought Bethune would do a\\nbetter job.\" \\n\\nAt America West, Texas Pacific initiated an even more\\nextensive management overhaul. This time, the charge was\\nled by Mr. Coulter and Mr. Schifter, both directors. \\n\\nW. Douglas Parker, the current chief executive, flew to Mr.\\nCoulter\\'s home in San Francisco to interview for the job of\\nchief financial officer. They talked for hours, and Mr.\\nParker said the two men quickly realized they had \"somewhat\\nkindred spirits.\" \\n\\nThe board replaced most senior managers at America West,\\nexcept William Franke, the chief executive, who stepped\\ndown last September. His restructuring plan had made the\\nairline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from\\nbankruptcy in August 1994. \\n\\nTexas Pacific owns just 3 percent of America West, worth\\nabout $33.7 million. But those are controlling shares, and\\nthe group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. \\n\\n\"These are not passive investors, nor am I,\" said Donald L.\\nSturm, a Denver businessman who serves on Continental\\'s\\nboard with Mr. Bonderman and Mr. Price. \"You\\'re active.\\nYour money is at stake. Your reputation is at stake.\" \\n\\nAfter overseeing managers who worked successfully with\\nunions at Continental and America West, Texas Pacific has a\\ngood reputation with labor. That was one reason US Airways\\nwas interested in a Texas Pacific investment, said Chris\\nChiames, a spokesman for the airline. \\n\\nMr. Siegel wanted an investor who would \"be as labor\\nfriendly as possible,\" Mr. Chiames said. But US Airways can\\nstill entertain other bids this fall, and Marvin Davis, the\\nbillionaire investor from Los Angeles, has expressed\\ninterest. \\n\\nTexas Pacific\\'s investment in Burger King, made with\\nGoldman, Sachs and Bain Capital, was announced after two\\nyears of discussions among Texas Pacific\\'s partners and the\\nchain\\'s franchisees - even before the company, which had\\nbeen owned by Diageo, the liquor company, was put up for\\nsale, said Julian Josephson, chairman of the National\\nFranchisee Association, which represents most Burger King\\nfranchisees. \\n\\n\"We liked what they had to say about the human component of\\nthe businesses they buy,\" Mr. Josephson said. Many other\\nowners, he added, \"are dismissive of labor.\" \\n\\nAt Burger King, Texas Pacific will also be working with an\\nexecutive it knows. Burger King\\'s chief executive is John\\nDasburg, the former chief executive of Northwest Airlines,\\nwho met Mr. Bonderman and his partners when Northwest\\nbought out their stake in Continental in 1998. \\n\\nUnlike most buyout firms, Texas Pacific remains enamored\\nwith the technology industry, despite the failure of so\\nmany start-ups the last two years. It has focused on the\\nsemiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is\\nhighly cyclical. So far, though, results have been mixed. \\n\\nThe firm\\'s 1996 acquisition of the Paradyne Corporation,\\nwhich makes equipment for high-speed Internet connections,\\nhas been a huge success. Texas Pacific split it in two and\\ntook both parts public in the late 1990\\'s, selling most of\\nits stakes for 23 times its investment. But a much larger\\ninvestment, its $400 million acquisition of Zilog, the chip\\nmaker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in\\nAsia caused chip prices to plummet. Zilog filed for\\nbankruptcy last year. \\n\\nTexas Pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third\\ncompany, ON Semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6\\nbillion three years ago. It invested $100 million more last\\nyear. \\n\\nIts latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for MEMC,\\nmay prove the most lucrative. The cost of mailing the\\npayment to E.On, based in D�sseldorf, Germany, was actually\\nmore than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal\\nsaid. \\n\\nTexas Pacific, and its partners in the deal, Trust Company\\nof the West and Leonard Green & Partners, agreed to\\nguarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. Texas\\nPacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of\\nwhich it swapped for more stock in the company. \\n\\n\"They did a good job of timing the acquisition,\" said\\nNabeel Gareeb, the company\\'s chief executive, who noted\\nthat in the last quarter MEMC reported its first profit\\nsince the fourth quarter of 2000. \\n\\nBut Texas Pacific\\'s interest in airlines is clearly\\nsizable. Besides its involvement in Continental, America\\nWest and US Airways, the company plans to buy Gate Gourmet,\\nthe catering business of the bankrupt Swissair Group. \\n\\nTwo years ago, Texas Pacific started a Web-based discount\\nticket service called Hotwire. It put up most of the $75\\nmillion in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to\\ninvest with it, said Karl Peterson, the chief executive.\\nHotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as\\nPriceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its Web site\\nbut does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until\\nafter the sale. \\n\\nThe contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt\\nHotwire, which is privately owned. Mr. Peterson said that\\nthe company was still unprofitable but that Texas Pacific\\nremains committed to it. \\n\\nLast spring, Mr. Peterson met Mr. Bonderman in Aspen to\\ntalk about Hotwire and to go snowboarding. Mr. Bonderman\\nseemed perfectly willing to accompany Hotwire down the\\nsteep Internet chute. But he does have his limits on risk,\\nMr. Peterson discovered. Before going down the mountain,\\nMr. Bonderman strapped on a helmet. � \\n\\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/25/business/yourmoney/25TEXA.html?ex=1031278887&ei=1&en=05fca479b8bcee6b\\n\\n\\n\\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\\n---------------------------------\\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters \\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The \\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact\\nonlinesales@nytimes.com or visit our online media \\nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\\n\\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to \\nhelp@nytimes.com.  \\n\\nCopyright 2002 The New York Times Company\\nhttp://xent.com/mailman/listinfo/fork\\n\\n'),\n",

Hettinga\" \\nSubject: California needs intelligent energy deregulation\\nSender: \\n\\nhttp://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4144696.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp\\n\\nPosted on Tue, Sep. 24, 2002\\n\\n\\nDan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulation\\n\\nBy Dan Gillmor\\nMercury News Technology Columnist\\n\\nThe facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy\\nindustry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify\\nsoaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.\\n\\nNow, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial\\nand fiscal mess we\\'ll be cleaning up for decades, we\\'re learning what\\neveryone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.\\n\\nThe latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday\\'s finding by a federal\\nadministrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed\\nsupplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after\\nCalifornia\\'s Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity\\ngenerators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,\\nalso driving up prices.\\n\\nAnd don\\'t forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked\\nthe system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider\\'s boast in a\\nmemorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to\\nrelieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any\\ncongestion.\\'\\'\\n\\nHow much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be\\nseen. Unfortunately, California\\'s response -- confusion, lawsuits and\\npolicy tweaks -- hasn\\'t been sufficient.\\n\\nMore unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --\\nincluding a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers\\'\\ngrips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it\\'s foolish to think\\nthat the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least\\nfavorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of\\ntraditional, non-renewable energy sources.\\n\\nIf the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any\\nfruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the\\nstate amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That\\'s a\\nreasonable approach, but don\\'t expect miracles.\\n\\nState policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.\\nInstead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if\\nit gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the\\nutilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,\\'\\'\\nnotes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for\\nEnergy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).\\n\\nIt\\'s tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --\\ntempting but a bad idea. When there\\'s genuine competition, as we could\\nachieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better\\njob. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to\\ninject real competition into the market.\\n\\nWe do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity\\ndefies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation\\nis essential.\\n\\nBut the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers\\ncontrol. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of\\nboth.\\n\\nThe best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up\\nthe use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California\\'s utilities\\nwill have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable\\nsources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.\\n\\nBut this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer\\nmodel we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer\\nideas isn\\'t enough.\\n\\nThe state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small\\ngenerators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,\\nharder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is\\ncoming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.\\n\\nInvesting to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.\\nCalifornia should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax\\nincentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn\\'t\\ndone badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did\\nreact to last year\\'s soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it\\'s\\nlunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it\\naltogether.\\n\\nMaybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration\\'s energy policies, so\\ngrossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are\\nmaking us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming\\nwar in Iraq goes badly.\\n\\nIt\\'s pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to\\ndrastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy\\nsystem. But the largest state, one of the world\\'s major economies in its\\nown right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it\\nhurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next\\nyear.\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------\\nR. A.

So what is the world thinking about?\\n\\nJENNIFER 8. LEE\\n\\nAt Google's squat headquarters off Route 101, visitors sit in the lobby, \\ntransfixed by the words scrolling by on the wall behind the \\nreceptionist's desk: animacio{AAC}n japonese Harry Potter pense{AAC}es \\net poemes associao brasileira de normas te{AAC}cnicas.\\n\\nThe projected display, called Live Query, shows updated samples of what \\npeople around the world are typing into Google's search engine. The \\nterms scroll by in English, Chinese, Spanish, Swedish, Japanese, Korean, \\nFrench, Dutch, Italian _ any of the 86 languages that Google tracks.\\n\\nThe scrolling continues: people who shouldn't marry ``she smoked a \\ncigar'' mr potatoheads in long island pickup lines to get women auto \\ntheft fraud how to.\\n\\nStare at Live Query long enough, and you feel you are watching the \\ncollective consciousness of the world stream by.\\n\\nEach line represents a thought from someone, somewhere with an Internet \\nconnection. Google collects these queries _ 150 million a day from more \\nthan 100 countries _ in its databases, updating and storing the computer \\nlogs millisecond by millisecond.\\n\\nGoogle is taking snapshots of its users' minds and aggregating them.\\n\\nSo what is the world thinking about?\\n\\nSex, for one thing.\\n\\n``You can learn to say `sex' in a lot of different languages by looking \\nat the logs,'' said Craig Silverstein, director of technology at Google. \\n(To keep Live Query G-rated, Google filters out sex-related searches, \\nthough less successfully with foreign languages.)\\n\\nDespite its geographic and ethnic diversity, the world is spending much \\nof its time thinking about the same things. The same topic areas bubble \\nto the top: celebrities, current events, products and computer downloads.\\n\\n``It's amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what \\nthey are searching for,'' said Greg Rae, one of three members of \\nGoogle's logs team, which is responsible for building, storing and \\nprotecting the data record.\\n\\nGoogle's following _ it is the most widely used search engine _ has \\ngiven Mr Rae a worldview from his cubicle. Since October 2001, he has \\nbeen able to reel off ``anthrax'' in several languages, including \\nmilzbrand in German and carbonchio in Italian. He says he can also tell \\nwhich countries took their recent elections seriously (Brazil and \\nGermany), because of the frenzy of searches. He notes that the \\nglobalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are \\nfar-flung in origin: Nokia, Sony, BMW, Ferrari, Ikea and Microsoft.\\n\\nJudging from Google's data, some sports events stir interest almost \\neverywhere: the Tour de France, Wimbledon, the Melbourne Cup horse race \\nand the World Series were among the top 10 sports-related searches last \\nyear. It also becomes obvious just how familiar American movies, music \\nand celebrities are to searchers across the globe. Two years ago, a \\nGoogle engineer named Lucas Pereira noticed that searches for Britney \\nSpears had declined, indicating what he thought must be a decline in her \\npopularity. From that observation grew Google Zeitgeist, a listing of \\nthe top gaining and declining queries of each week and month.\\n\\nGlancing over Google Zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural \\nliteracy: Ulrika Jonsson, the Swedish-born British television host and \\ngirlfriend of England football coach Sven Goran Eriksson, made the list \\nrecently. So did Irish Travellers (a nomadic ethnic group, one of whose \\nmembers was videotaped beating her young daughter in Indiana) and \\nfentanyl (the narcotic gas used in the Moscow raid to rescue hostages \\ntaken by Chechen rebels in late October).\\n\\nThe long-lasting volume of searches involving her name has made Britney \\nSpears something of a benchmark for the logs team. It has helped them \\nunderstand how news can cause spikes in searches, as it did when she \\nbroke up with Justin Timberlake.\\n\\nGoogle can feel the reverberations of such events, and others of a more \\nserious nature, immediately.\\n\\nOn Feb 28, 2001, for example, an earthquake began near Seattle at 10:54 \\nam local time. Within two minutes, earthquake-related searches jumped to \\n250 a minute from almost none, with a concentration in the US Pacific \\nNorthwest. On Sept 11, searches for the World Trade Center, Pentagon and \\nCNN shot up immediately after the attacks. Over the next few days, \\nNostradamus became the top search query, fuelled by a rumour that \\nNostradamus had predicted the trade center's destruction.\\n\\nBut the most trivial events may also register on Google's sensitive \\ncultural seismic meter.\\n\\nThe logs team came to work one morning to find that ``carol brady maiden \\nname'' had surged to the top of the charts.\\n\\nCurious, they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they \\nwere neatly grouped in five spikes, each one starting at 48 minutes \\nafter the hour.\\n\\nAs the logs were passed through the office, employees were perplexed. \\nWhy would there be a surge in interest in a character from the 1970s \\nsitcom The Brady Bunch? But the data could only reflect patterns, not \\nexplain them.\\n\\nThat is a paradox of a Google log: it does not capture social phenomena \\nper se, but merely the shadows they cast across the Internet.\\n\\n``The most interesting part is why,'' said Amit Patel, who has been a \\nmember of the logs team. ``You can't interpret it unless you know what \\nelse is going on in the world.''\\n\\nSo what had gone on on April 22, 2001?\\n\\nThat night the million-dollar question on the game show Who Wants to Be \\na Millionaire? had been, ``What was Carol Brady's maiden name?'' Seconds \\nafter the show's host posed the question, thousands flocked to Google to \\nsearch for the answer (Tyler), producing four spikes as the show was \\nbroadcast successively in each US time zone.\\n\\nThe precision of the Carol Brady data was eye-opening for some.\\n\\n``It was like trying an electron microscope for the first time,'' said \\nSergey Brin, who as a graduate student in computer science at Stanford \\nhelped found Google in 1998 and is now its president for technology. \\n``It was like a moment-by-moment barometer.''\\n\\nPredictably, Google's query data respond to television, movies and \\nradio. But the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences. \\nOne of Google's strengths is its predictive power, flagging trends \\nbefore they hit the radar of other media.\\n\\nAs such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or \\nretailers. Google is quiet about what if any plans it has for \\ncommercialising its vast store of query information. ``There is \\ntremendous opportunity with this data,'' Mr Silverstein said. ``The \\nchallenge is defining what we want to do.''\\n\\nGoogle currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data \\nbecause of privacy concerns. Searches are logged by time of day, \\noriginating IP address (information that can be used to link searches to \\na specific computer), and the sites on which the user clicked. People \\ntell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly \\n_ Viagra, pregnancy scares, fraud, facelifts. What is interesting in the \\naggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an individual.\\n\\nIn aggregate form, Google's data can make a stunning presentation. Next \\nto Mr Rae's cubicle is the GeoDisplay, a 40-inch screen that gives a \\nthree-dimensional geographical representation of where Google is being \\nused around the globe. The searches are represented by coloured dots \\nshooting into the atmosphere. The colours _ red, yellow, orange _ convey \\nthe impression of a globe whose major cities are on fire. The tallest \\nflames are in New York, Tokyo and the San Francisco Bay area.\\n\\nEach country has a distinctive usage pattern. Spain, France and Italy \\nhave a midday lull in Google searches, presumably reflecting leisurely \\nlunches and relaxation. In Japan, the peak usage is after midnight, when \\nphone rates for dial-up modems drop.\\n\\nGoogle's worldwide scope means that the company can track ideas and \\nphenomena as they hop from country to country.\\n\\nTake Las Ketchup, a trio of singing sisters who became a sensation in \\nSpain last spring with a gibberish song and accompanying knee-knocking \\ndance similar to the Macarena.\\n\\nLike a series of waves, Google searches for Las Ketchup undulated \\nthrough Europe over the summer and fall.\\n\\nThe Ketchup Song (Hey Hah) has already topped the charts in 18 \\ncountries. In late summer, Google's logs show, Las Ketchup searches \\nbegan a strong upward climb in the United States, Britain and the \\nNetherlands.\\n\\nHaven't heard of Las Ketchup?\\n\\nIf you haven't, Google predicts you soon will.\\n===\\n\\nrgrds,\\nBernard\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nIIU mailing list\\nIIU@iiu.taint.org\\nhttp://iiu.taint.org/mailman/listinfo/iiu\\n\\n\\n\"),\n",

              "  'Why am I so passionate about decentralization? Because I believe some of \\ntoday’s most profound problems with networked applications are caused by \\ncentralization.\\n\\nGenerically, a centralized political or economic system permits only one \\nanswer to a question, while decentralization permits many separate \\nagents to hold different opinions of the same matter. In the specific \\ncontext of software, centralized variables can only contain one valid \\nvalue at a time. That limits us to only representing information A) \\naccording to the beliefs of a single agency, and B) that changes more \\nslowly than it takes to propagate. Nevertheless, centralization is the \\nbasis for today’s most popular architectural style for developing \\nnetwork applications: client-server interaction using request-response \\ncommunication protocols.\\n\\nI believe these are profound limitations, which we are already \\nencountering in practice. Spam, for example, is in the eye of the \\nbeholder, yet our email protocols and tools do not acknowledge the \\nseparate interests of senders and receivers. Slamming, for another, \\nunfairly advantages the bidder with the lowest-latency connection to a \\ncentralized auction server. Sharing ad-hoc wireless networks is yet a \\nthird example of decentralized resource allocation. Furthermore, as \\nabstract as centralization-induced failures might seem today, these \\nlimits will _not_ improve as the cost of computing, storage, and \\ncommunication bandwidth continue to plummet. Instead, the speed of light \\nand human independence constitute _fundamental_ limits to centralized \\ninformation representation, and hence centralized software architecture.\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term\\nsignificance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static\\napplication code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large\\nclient/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because\\nthese are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different\\nsets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also\\ntend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular\\nwith the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence\\nservices at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a\\nphysical architecture that has a static web server, a static application\\nserver, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I\\nuse the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable\\nbecause the \"unchangeable\" partitions might be written to for temporary swap\\nspace. Who knows what Windows does internally?)\\n\\nMy point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID\\ndevice that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image\\npartition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but\\nsolid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of\\nbase images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the\\nserver is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then\\nmarket this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that\\nrely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer\\noverflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized\\nmodification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this\\nparticular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend\\napplication data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself\\nhas not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could\\nhelp.\\n\\nI would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a\\nhardware RAID vendor to implement. (I\\'m just guessing, of course, with no\\nknowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a\\nproduct, I\\'d love to hear about it.\\n\\nBen\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

What the WSJ said, appended below.\\n\\n\\nThe WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,\\nexpropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at\\nthe behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the \"good\"\\nof the city, and owned by an \"authority\" looking for something else\\nto do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized\\ncrime, had killed what was the largest port in the world\\'s richest\\nnation.\\n\\nNow, of course, it\\'s about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago\\nhave been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally\\nirrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in\\ngovernment.\\n\\nAs a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly\\nusable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will\\nbe \"granted\" away  in a potlatch that only government, and\\nspecial-interest \"communities\", (or \"stakeholders\", or whatever the\\ncryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize\\nto such perfection.\\n\\n\\nAll this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded\\nby a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not\\nreligious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch\\'s name.\\n*Commerce*.\\n\\n\\nIf they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites\\nwho collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects\\non a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called\\n\"authority\" should disband itself and sell its property off to the\\nhighest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,\\nforeign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.\\n\\nIf the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for\\na memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the\\nfamilies of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the\\nproperty, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the\\nevent.\\n\\nAnd, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as\\ntall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square\\nfeet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.\\n\\n\\nIn these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic\\ninternetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially\\ndecreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,\\neconomics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition\\nand statism.\\n\\nIt\\'s probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower\\nManhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but\\nit\\'s going to happen sooner or later.\\n\\nAnd, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who\\ndied at the World Trade Center.\\n\\nCheers,\\nRAH\\n\\n- -------\\n\\nhttp://online.wsj.com/article_print/0,,SB1031705210159756235,00.html\\n\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal\\n\\nSeptember 11, 2002\\nREVIEW & OUTLOOK\\n\\nA Living Memorial\\n\\nAs we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the\\nsix-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone\\nelse, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who\\ndied a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who\\nperished would be a living one.\\n\\nThe site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,\\nespecially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of\\nheroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of\\nthe enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were\\nattacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best\\nexpression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be\\nto once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries\\nworking, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of\\nproductive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin\\nLaden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.\\n\\nBut restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has\\nbeen about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous\\nrebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the\\nTrade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and\\nscale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now\\nclamoring for a piece of the action. New York\\'s political leadership,\\nand its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance\\nto rebuild a better, more prosperous city.\\n\\nThis is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out\\nwhat to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor\\nGeorge Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November\\nre-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the\\nmemorial. The Manhattan Institute\\'s Steve Malanga argues that the\\ncommission would have been better off setting aside a limited space\\nfor the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning\\nto the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so\\nsuccessfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for\\nan outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.\\n\\nA big part of the problem in New York is that the city\\'s\\nanti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They\\nwant the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas\\n- -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have\\nhad plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in\\nNew York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World\\nTrade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are\\ncynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own\\nanti-development agenda in the name of \"honoring\" the dead. One\\nfamily group even called a press conference to reject as\\ndisrespectful a proposed train line under the site.\\n\\nWe are not experts in designing war memorials, but we\\'re confident\\nthat a gigantic park in the heart of the world\\'s financial center\\nisn\\'t the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great\\ncities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all\\nrebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban\\nlife. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port\\ncity reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a\\nstatue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.\\n\\nIn this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to\\nbe inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were\\naffiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,\\nyou\\'ll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary\\nWar, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World\\nWar I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it\\ndisrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on\\naround the walls containing their names.\\n\\nIn New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the\\nemotional tug of the victims and their families to the city\\'s future.\\nRudolph Giuliani, now that he\\'s out office, wants the entire 16 acres\\ndevoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures\\non the \"footprints,\" which, being in the center of the site, would\\nseverely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised\\nhis voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the\\npress and has since ducked for cover.\\n\\nMaybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe\\nthose responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking\\nmore about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best\\nway to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: PGP 7.5\\n\\niQA/AwUBPX9zD8PxH8jf3ohaEQI2aACgv7mtb5VKTpRj5MJQt1OyzyifzusAn273\\nfgNkOntna6+SmLO8TB4XYbC2\\n=09az\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n-- \\n-----------------\\nR.

Unlike competing solutions that \\nprocess XML data in software, DataPower\\'s device processes the data in \\nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \\naccording to company officials.\\n\\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a\\n\\nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The\\n\\nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \\ndata.\\n\\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \\nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \\nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \\nbusinesses.\\n\\n\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \\n\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\\n\\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up\\n\\nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \\napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\nalternative.\\n\\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \\nimportance in the world of XML.\\n\\n\"Today\\'s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \\nsaid. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \\nFirewalls are blind to XML today.\"\\n\\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\\n\\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \\nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company\\n\\nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \\nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \\ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\\n\\n\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \\nadding that to his knowledge no other company\\'s solution does. Kelly \\nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \\nwill be mostly false.\\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \\naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet,\\n\\nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes\\n\\nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\\n\\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of\\n\\nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \\nas they pass through the device.\\n\\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \\nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\\n\\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application\\n\\nco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \\ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \\ncontrols the device.\\n\\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \\nSarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in\\n\\nMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \\nfocus on content processing and acceleration.\\nThe DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The \\ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \\nfield trails at a number of other enterprises.\\n\\n========================================================================\\n=\\n\\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \\nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \\nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \\nwould have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML \\ngrew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \\ndesigned the industry\\'s first solutions to address the unique \\nrequirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software \\ninterpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing \\nis still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.\\n\\nLeveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \\ndeveloping software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov\\'s team raised the bar \\nand designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In \\n2001, DataPower\\'s effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the \\nindustry\\'s fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\\n\\nToday, XG3™ technology powers the industry\\'s first wire-speed XML \\nnetwork devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \\nServices. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of\\n\\nproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, \\nproviding an immediate return on technology investments to \\nindustry-leading customers and partners.\\n\\nDataPower\\'s M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that \\nbrings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries,\\n\\ndrawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including \\nAkamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.\\n\\n========================================================================\\n=\\n\\nDataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding\\n\\nVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer\\n\\nin XML-Aware Networking for Web Services\\n\\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the \\nleading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced \\nthat it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing.

If they had, third party developers would have\\nupdated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have\\nresigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first\\nplace.\\n\\nBut what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly\\nexclude all non-Apple menu extras.

The British\\n countryside is crawling with pumas, black panthers, fen tigers and other big,\\n vicious cats. No corner of the nation is safe. Evidence released yesterday,\\n including sightings, photographs, paw prints, livestock kills and hair\\n samples, claims to prove that every county has big cats lurking in its\\n undergrowth, poised to pounce on man and beast alike. \\n \\n Sightings have reached record levels in 2002, according to Daniel Bamping,\\n founder of the British Big Cats Society, which in the past 12 months has\\n received more than 800 reports of big cat sightings. \\n \\n \\x93During the first six months we have seen an incredible amount of big cat\\n activity. We have now had reports in every single county; the response from\\n the public has been fantastic,\\x94 Mr Bamping said. \\x93Big cats in Britain are\\n real. They are out there, they are breeding; there\\x92s more of them.\\x94 \\n \\n Scotland and Gloucestershire are said to be hotspots of big cat activity. Mark\\n Fraser, who heads the society\\x92s Scottish arm, said: \\x93Lynx are now present in\\n the Scottish countryside; I believe they are established and breeding. I don\\x92t\\n want to hazard a guess at the numbers; suffice it to say there are several\\n hotspots, notably Fife, Aberdeenshire, Inverness and the Borders.\\x94 \\n \\n Next month the society plans to unveil its full dossier of evidence, which\\n includes two dead wild cats, pictures of paw prints and tree scratchings, as\\n well as stories of a horse strangely lacerated in West Wales and a man in\\n Gravesham, Kent, who had to beat a hasty retreat to his garage after his hand\\n was cut by a creature the size of a labrador dog, except that it had black\\n hairy tufts on the tips of its ears. \\n \\n The society is taking the sightings seriously. It plans to set up a network of\\n trigger-cameras throughout the country to capture further evidence of the\\n beasts, which it will then present to the Government. \\n \\n It is not, however, clear on what it wants the Government to do about it all.\\n Throwing its weight behind the pro-hunting lobby might be a start. \\n \\n Next in August: record abductions by aliens.\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

The murder \\nof children is something of an Indian specialty. The routine daily \\nkillings of unwanted girl babies . . . the massacre of innocents in \\nNellie, Assam, in the 1980s when village turned against neighboring \\nvillage . . . the massacre of Sikh children in Delhi during the \\nhorrifying reprisal murders that followed Indira Gandhi\\'s assassination: \\nThey bear witness to our particular gift, always most dazzlingly in \\nevidence at times of religious unrest, for dousing our children in \\nkerosene and setting them alight, or cutting their throats, or \\nsmothering them or just clubbing them to death with a good strong length \\nof wood.\\n\\nI say \"our\" because I write as an Indian man, born and bred, who loves \\nIndia deeply and knows that what one of us does today, any of us is \\npotentially capable of doing tomorrow. If I take pride in India\\'s \\nstrengths, then India\\'s sins must be mine as well. Do I sound angry? \\nGood. Ashamed and disgusted? I certainly hope so. Because, as India \\nundergoes its worst bout of Hindu-Muslim bloodletting in more than a \\ndecade, many people have not been sounding anything like angry, ashamed \\nor disgusted enough. Police chiefs have been excusing their men\\'s \\nunwillingness to defend the citizens of India, without regard to \\nreligion, by saying that these men have feelings too and are subject to \\nthe same sentiments as the nation in general.\\n\\nMeanwhile, India\\'s political masters have been tut-tutting and offering \\nthe usual soothing lies about the situation being brought under control. \\n(It has escaped nobody\\'s notice that the ruling party, the Bharatiya \\nJanata Party (BJP), or Indian People\\'s Party, and the Hindu extremists \\nof the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), or World Hindu Council, are sister \\norganizations and offshoots of the same parent body.) Even some \\ninternational commentators, such as Britain\\'s Independent newspaper, \\nurge us to \"beware excess pessimism.\"\\n\\nThe horrible truth about communal slaughter in India is that we\\'re used \\nto it. It happens every so often; then it dies down. That\\'s how life is, \\nfolks. Most of the time India is the world\\'s largest secular democracy; \\nand if, once in a while, it lets off a little crazy religious steam, we \\nmustn\\'t let that distort the picture.\\n\\nOf course, there are political explanations. Ever since December 1992, \\nwhen a VHP mob demolished a 400-year-old Muslim mosque in Ayodhya, which \\nthey claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god Ram, Hindu \\nfanatics have been looking for this fight. The pity of it is that some \\nMuslims were ready to give it to them. Their murderous attack on the \\ntrain-load of VHP activists at Godhra (with its awful, atavistic echoes \\nof the killings of Hindus and Muslims by the train-load during the \\npartition riots of 1947) played right into the Hindu extremists\\' hands.\\n\\nThe VHP has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and \\ninsufficient radicalism of India\\'s BJP government. Prime Minister Atal \\nBihari Vajpayee is more moderate than his party; he also heads a \\ncoalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the BJP\\'s \\nmore extreme Hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together. \\nBut it isn\\'t working anymore. In state elections across the country, the \\nBJP is being trounced. This may have been the last straw for the VHP \\nfirebrands. Why put up with the government\\'s betrayal of their fascistic \\nagenda when that betrayal doesn\\'t even result in electoral success?\\n\\nThe electoral failure of the BJP is thus, in all probability, the spark \\nthat lit the fire. The VHP is determined to build a Hindu temple on the \\nsite of the demolished Ayodhya mosque -- that\\'s where the Godhra dead \\nwere coming from -- and there are, reprehensibly, idiotically, \\ntragically, Muslims in India equally determined to resist them. Vajpayee \\nhas insisted that the slow Indian courts must decide the rights and \\nwrongs of the Ayodhya issue. The VHP is no longer prepared to wait.\\n\\nThe distinguished Indian writer Mahasveta Devi, in a letter to India\\'s \\npresident, K. R. Narayanan, blames the Gujarat government (led by a BJP \\nhard-liner) as well as the central government for doing \"too little too \\nlate.\" She pins the blame firmly on the \"motivated, well-planned out and \\nprovocative actions\" of the Hindu nationalists. But another writer, the \\nNobel laureate V. S. Naipaul, speaking in India just a week before the \\nviolence erupted, denounced India\\'s Muslims en masse and praised the \\nnationalist movement.\\n\\nThe murderers of Godhra must indeed be denounced, and Mahasveta Devi in \\nher letter demands \"stern legal action\" against them. But the VHP is \\ndetermined to destroy that secular democracy in which India takes such \\npublic pride and which it does so little to protect; and by supporting \\nthem, Naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces \\nthe Nobel award.\\n\\nThe political discourse matters, and explains a good deal. But there\\'s \\nsomething beneath it, something we don\\'t want to look in the face: \\nnamely, that in India, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is \\nthe poison in the blood. Where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no \\nexcuse. Yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in \\nthe fashionable language of \"respect.\" What is there to respect in any \\nof this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around \\nthe world in religion\\'s dreaded name? How well, with what fatal results, \\nreligion erects totems, and how willing we are to kill for them! And \\nwhen we\\'ve done it often enough, the deadening of affect that results \\nmakes it easier to do it again.\\n\\nSo India\\'s problem turns out to be the world\\'s problem.

              "  'The Electronic Telegraph\\n\\n Emigrate to Russia? That\\'s a steppe too far\\n (Filed: 28/08/2002) \\n \\n \\n So you think you\\'ve got it bad: fed up with Folkestone, bored with Birmingham\\n or sick of Sheffield.\\n \\n Those 54 per cent of Britons - according to a Daily Telegraph/YouGov survey\\n this week - who dream of a stress-free life in sunnier climes should perhaps\\n heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad.\\n \\n Kommersant, a Russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied\\n with life in Blair\\'s Britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to\\n emigrate to provincial Russia.\\n \\n After reading about the gripes of affluent Britons, its tongue-in-cheek\\n article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other\\n side.\\n \\n \"The inhabitants of foggy Albion keen to travel could go to any Russian city\\n deep in the provinces where things are quiet,\" said Kommersant.\\n \\n \"In any central Russian district, life, by British standards, is unseemingly\\n cheap and remarkably laid back. By 11am most of the working population are\\n becoming \\'traditionally\\' relaxed.\"\\n \\n The time for elevenses in Britain - perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of\\n tea and a chocolate Hobnob - is known in Russia as the Wolf Hour.\\n \\n It was so named in Soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the\\n famous animal clock at the Obrasov Puppet Theatre in Moscow. It is also\\n opening time in the nation\\'s vodka shops.\\n \\n And the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. Kommersant pointed out that\\n \"the money a Briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be\\n enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their\\n life.\\n \\n \"The local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle\\n of whisky for kopecks.\"\\n \\n There are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a\\n halfpenny in sterling.\\n \\n The whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average Briton\\n will have consumed before. It is made of samagon - home-distilled, moonshine\\n vodka - coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among\\n diehard alcoholics.\\n \\n While alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. The\\n newspaper pointed out that traditional British foodstuffs - it selected oxtail\\n soup as an example - were in short supply. However, the wealth of the British\\n settler should overcome the difficulty.\\n \\n \"For a modest reward in most Russian villages, the locals would happily cut\\n off the tails from the entire collective farm\\'s herd of cattle.\"\\n \\n One or two potential emigrés might be deterred by language difficulties. There\\n are few English speakers to be found among the green hills of Tula on the\\n Mongolian border.\\n \\n However, Kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a\\n deterrent by the 13 per cent of Britons who nominated France as the country in\\n which they would like to live.\\n \\n France, the Russian paper claimed, was a country \"where English is only known\\n by the beggars, Belorussian prostitutes and Russian tourists\".\\n \\n Despite the low cost of living and the easy-going lifestyle, the Russian\\n weather remains a major stumbling block for Britons.\\n \\n Even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of -20C are common.\\n And somewhere like the Sakha Republic - east of Siberia and the coldest place\\n in the world - enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures\\n that drop below -70C. Houses are built on concrete stilts because the\\n permafrost makes digging foundations impossible.\\n \\n Again, the Russian paper had a word of reassurance. While acknowledging the\\n climatic problems, it said that \"thanks to global warming this difficulty will\\n solve itself\".\\n \\n Kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in\\n Britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in Russia.\\n \\n \"Thirty-three million Russians could be sent to Britain to replace the 33\\n million who leave. We think that the required number could probably be found\\n amongst our citizens.\"\\n \\n Unfortunately for those 33 million Russians, however, not one of those Britons\\n surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the Russian steppes as their\\n preferred new home.\\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

I say \\nhalf-hearted because I\\'m still application-centric, and I don\\'t go as far with \\nkeyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don\\'t use the desktop at all (never have, \\non any system), and I don\\'t use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I \\npersonally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step \\ntowards a productive system is managing your Start menu. \\n\\nI use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most \\ncommon programs. \"0 Control Panel[3]\", \"1 Mozilla[4]\", \"2 Emacs[5]\", \"3 DOS \\nhome\", \"4 DOS work\", \"5 DOS incoming\" (each of which gives me a command line, \\nbut in different directories), \"7 Python[6]\", \"9 IE\". Also \"# Explorer home\", \\n\"$ Explorer work\", \"% Explorer incoming\", which open Explorer windows in \\nvarious useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only \\nwith the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went \\nto my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus \\n(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique \\nfirst letters as needed. \"Ad-aware[7]\", \"Excel[8]\", \"IM\", \"Netscape 4[9]\", \\n\"Paint Shop Pro\", \"Query Tool (ODBC)[10]\", \"VMWare[11]\", \"Word[12]\". All other \\nsubmenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete \\n\"Accessories\". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it\\'s probably a sign of a \\nlarger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like \\nWinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean \\nPrograms menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. \\n\\nOn most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens \\nthe start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your \\nfingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a \\nnew command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for \\ncompatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always \\nopen, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I\\'m done using them \\n(mostly because my laptop doesn\\'t have a lot of memory). \\n\\nI install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a \\ncollection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, \\ncp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And \\nbash, which I don\\'t use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I \\nalso set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to \\n120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x \\n3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don\\'t let the system position the \\nwindow. \\n\\nIn Mozilla, I set my home page to \"about:blank\", set Internet Search to search \\nwith Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible \\ncases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for \\nweblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the \\nbackground). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open \\nunrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, \\ndelete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes \\nme to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], \\nfrom which I can find all other bookmarks I need. \\n\\nIn Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since \\nthat\\'s the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between \\nMozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, \\nsince TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and \\npasting weblog entries virtually impossible. \\n\\nI use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is \\nso heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named \\nfoo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which \\nis world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this \\nsometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which \\nis actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files \\nin a single directory (d:\\\\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI \\nscripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin\\'s bash shell \\nfor M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the \\nname of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept \"y\" and \"n\" for \\nyes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when \\nI press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get \\nall text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My \\n_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. \\n\\nI don\\'t use Windows\\' useless directory structure for user home directories. On \\nmy D drive I have d:\\\\home (contains directories for my books and other personal \\nprojects, each under CVS control—also set as my home directory using the \\nHOME environment variable), d:\\\\work (contains directories for each work \\nproject, also under CVS), d:\\\\incoming (set as default download directory for \\nall programs that download things), and d:\\\\backup (used by Emacs, and for \\ntemporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly \\ncreated CVS projects). I don\\'t know or care what\\'s where on my C drive. \\n\\nI have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email \\naddresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal \\ninformation in a text file called phone, stored in d:\\\\home\\\\phone.

              "  'from http://www.arstechnica.com/\\n\\n\"There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department\\nof Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against\\nindividuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted\\nmaterial over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes\\nthat \"criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to\\npreserve the viability of America\\'s content industries.\" Malcolm also\\nbelieves that people who trade copyrighted material think they are\\nparticipating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download\\ncopyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions\\nsuch as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see\\nbusinesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of\\ncopyrighted works.\\n\\n\\n\"Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think\\nthey would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal\\nprosecution,\" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same\\nconference panel.\\n\\nI\\'m not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is\\nhoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or\\nwarnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor\\ndeterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits\\ncarrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate\\nfurther animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to\\ninitiate because of the \"schooling\" effect of millions of systems\\nparticipating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from\\nthe crowd.\\n\\nThe article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines\\nillegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:\\n\\n\\nCriminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for\\npurposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the\\nreproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any\\n180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more\\ncopyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....\\nFor purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution\\nof a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish\\nwillful infringement.\\n...\\nThe term \"financial gain\" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of\\nanything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.\\n\\n\\nTherefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as \"financial gain\"\\neven if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the\\nvalue of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15\\nto millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the\\nperspective of the consumer or copyright holder.\\n\\nThe statute of limitations:\\n\\n\\n507. Limitations on actions\\n\\n(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained\\nunder the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five\\nyears after the cause of action arose.\\n\\n(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the\\nprovisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after\\nthe claim accrued.\\n\\nThe penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in\\nSection 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time\\ncriminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.\\n\\nI\\'m still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to\\nprosecute because of the aforementioned \"schooling\" effect, but my guess\\nwould be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent\\nindividuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be\\ntargeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers.

All\\nElvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or\\ncollect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as\\nsomething of their own.  But it\\'s not _Elvis_ who made them universal\\nstatements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into\\ntheir own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.\\n\\nTherefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay\\nbefore they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royalties\\nfor listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for\\na beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over\\nagain for the /right/ to make some hack writer\\'s song /their/\\nfavourite song????  That\\'s where the whole system has been seriously\\nwarped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your\\nthinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It\\'s not.  It\\'s\\nthe people who make them; the songs are already theirs.\\n\\n-- \\nGary Lawrence Murphy  TeleDynamics Communications Inc\\n Business Advantage through Community Software : http://www.teledyn.com\\n\"Computers are useless.

Col. Michael Humm, a Pentagon spokesman, said the incident happened\\nWednesday and that the North American Aerospace Defense Command in Colorado\\nSprings, Colo., was continuing to investigate. \\n\\nThe reported contrail stirred concern because of the possibility that it\\ncould have indicated the presence of an unauthorized jet aircraft in or\\napproaching American airspace. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, the\\nPentagon has taken greater precautions to monitor U.S. airspace. \\n\\nA contrail is created by vapor from a jet engine in the presence of cold\\nair. \\n\\nThe jets that were scrambled to attempt to intercept and identify the source\\nof the contrail found nothing, said Lt. Cmdr. Curtis Jenkins, a NORAD\\nspokesman. He said NORAD had developed no new information since the initial\\nreport at 4 p.m. EST on Wednesday. NORAD is reviewing data from its tracking\\nradars in search of evidence, he said. \\n\\nA Pentagon statement said NORAD received unverified reports of ``what\\nappeared to be a contrail of unknown origin,\\'\\' originally in the vicinity of\\nthe Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean. \\n\\n``Initially, it was reported to be heading northwestward toward the United\\nStates,\\'\\' the statement said. ``Commercial airline pilots later reported the\\ncontrail over Florida and later over Indiana. Thereafter, no other sightings\\nwere reported.\\'\\' \\n\\nThe reported contrail was never verified by visual or radar contact, the\\nPentagon statement said. \\n\\nAt the Federal Aviation Administration, spokesman Paul Turk said, ``I\\'m\\naware of the reports.\\'\\' He referred all questions to NORAD. \\n\\nJenkins said he was not sure who reported the initial sighting over the\\nCaribbean. He also was unsure who requested NORAD to launch fighter jets or\\nfrom which military bases they were scrambled. \\n\\n``We don\\'t necessarily judge or second-guess when a request comes to us to\\ninvestigate\\'\\' a contrail, he said. \\n\\nMeanwhile, reports of a ball of fire streaking across the sky early Thursday\\nhad people throughout the Northwest flooding radio and television stations\\nwith calls reporting a meteor shower. \\n\\nIt was believed that the light came from a Russian rocket body re-entering\\nthe Earth\\'s atmosphere about 6:15 a.m. The U.S. Strategic Command in Omaha,\\nNeb., and the North American Aerospace Defense Command confirmed a Russian\\nrocket fell back to Earth, but gave no further details. \\n\\n\\nAP-NY-11-28-02 1833EST\\n\\nCopyright 2002, The Associated Press.

But rather than\\nhave the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it\\nwould have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to\\ndo is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck\\na \"catch\" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the\\nuser has typed.\\n\\nThis way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe\\nallowing a sequence name, like \"prev\" or \"next\", or anything else can\\nbe handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have\\nto go fix the selection processing code to allow it.\\n\\nBut, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.\\nIf you type \"66+\" the \"66\" changes to \"67\" (and so on, for each + that\\nis typed).   I suspect that\\'s perhaps an artifact of \"+ is bound to a\\ndifferent function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the\\ncurrent and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current\\ninput mode is a message number, so let it mean...\", but now I found it,\\nI think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That\\nkind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.\\n\\nAnd then I wondered about folders with names containing \\'+\\' - the special\\nuse of + as the toggle character means there\\'s no way to type those from\\nthe keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different\\nrestrictions - there\\'s no way to type a folder name that has a name\\nbeginning with \\'+\\' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,\\nso I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to\\ntoggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name\\nbeing typed is empty.   I\\'m less happy about that part, but I think I\\ncan live with it in order to allow folder names with +\\'s in them to\\nexist and be typed.\\n\\nThen, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another\\nfeature that has always bugged me.   In \"normal\" keyboard mode, \\'s\\' is\\nthe key used to show a message.    But if you\\'ve just typed 123, and\\nthe FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now\\nshow that message, you can\\'t type \\'s\\', you have to type \\\\r instead.\\nSo I \"fixed\" this one as well.   \"Fixed\" here is in quotes, as it assumes\\nthat the keybinding for MsgShow is \\'s\\', if you change that to something\\nelse, it will remain \\'s\\' in here.   I don\\'t know enough tk/tcl to have it\\ndiscover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order\\nto bind the same one here.   \\\\r continues to work of course.\\n\\nAnd now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it\\nclear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).\\nPreviously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next\\nmessage appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had\\nreverted to its usual bindings.\\n\\nIn any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe\\nthat if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the\\n\"catch\" around the \"MsgShow\" will hide the problem (I don\\'t think we really\\nneed to fix Brent\\'s way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just\\nfor completeness (I haven\\'t run an exmh with the following patch, but not\\nthe previous one, so I don\\'t know for sure that all will be OK then).\\n\\nkre\\n\\n--- select.tcl.WAS\\tThu Aug 22 21:15:07 2002\\n+++ select.tcl\\tWed Aug 28 13:36:17 2002\\n@@ -49,9 +49,11 @@\\n     bindtags $w [list $w Entry]\\n     bind $w \\t{SelectTypein %W %A}\\n     bind $w \\t{SelectToggle %W }\\n+    bind $w \\t{SelectPrev %W }\\n     bind $w \\t{SelectComplete %W}\\n     bind $w \\t{SelectComplete %W}\\n     bind $w \\t{SelectReturn %W}\\n+    bind $w \\t{SelectReturn %W %A}\\n     bind $w \\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\\n     bind $w \\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\\n     bind $w \\t{SelectBackSpace %W}\\n@@ -72,7 +74,7 @@\\n     append select(sel) $a\\n     Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n     if ![info exists select(folder)] {\\n-\\tMsg_Change $select(sel) noshow\\n+\\tcatch { Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow }\\n     }\\n }\\n proc SelectBackSpace { w } {\\n@@ -91,6 +93,10 @@\\n proc SelectToggle {w} {\\n     global select\\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n+\\tif {$select(sel) != \"\"} {\\n+\\t    SelectTypein $w +\\n+\\t    return\\n+\\t}\\n \\tset select(toggle) [list [lindex $select(toggle) 1] [lindex $select(toggle) 0]]\\n \\tset select(prompt) \"[lindex $select(toggle) 0] Folder:\"\\n     } else {\\n@@ -101,6 +107,18 @@\\n     }\\n     Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n }\\n+proc SelectPrev {w} {\\n+    global select\\n+    if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n+\\tSelectTypein $w \"-\"\\n+    } else {\\n+\\tcatch {\\n+\\t    incr select(sel) -1\\n+\\t    Msg_Change $select(sel) noshow\\n+\\t}\\n+        Exmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n+    }\\n+}\\n proc SelectComplete { w } {\\n     global select\\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n@@ -126,9 +144,13 @@\\n \\tExmh_Status \"$select(prompt) $select(sel)\"\\n     }\\n }\\n-proc SelectReturn { w } {\\n+proc SelectReturn { w {a {}} } {\\n     global select\\n     if [info exists select(folder)] {\\n+\\tif {$a != {}} {\\n+\\t    SelectTypein $w $a\\n+\\t    return\\n+\\t}\\n \\tif [info exists select(match)] {\\n \\t    set select(sel) $select(match)\\n \\t    unset select(match)\\n@@ -151,6 +173,7 @@\\n \\tunset select(folder)\\n     }\\n     $select(entry) configure -state disabled\\n+    Exmh_Status \"\"\\n     Exmh_Focus\\n }\\n proc SelectClear { w } {\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________\\nExmh-workers mailing list\\nExmh-workers@redhat.com\\nhttps://listman.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/exmh-workers\\n\\n'),\n",

              "  'Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with\\nspammers while we\\'re getting judgments against them and especially in\\nother countries, where those judgments are harder to get.\\n\\nPlease note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after\\nregular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant\\npyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the\\nvast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, I\\ncan\\'t understand how Daniel can assert that you can\\'t track spammers\\ndown when it\\'s never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of\\nthe business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of\\nthe ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for\\nthe whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes,\\nthese people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they\\'re not\\nsecret agents.  They\\'re just trying to make a buck, and Habeas\\' whole\\nbusiness is about finding them and putting them out of business\\n\\nHabeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark)\\nin a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business\\nplan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with \"not spam\", I can\\'t\\nunderstand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be\\nunsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the\\npotential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the\\nHabeas warrant mark.\\n\\nDaniel, it\\'s easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on\\nyour installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only\\nlicense the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on\\nthe HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove\\nus from the next release.  But, you\\'re trying to kill Habeas before it\\nhas a chance to show any promise.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it\\nencourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those\\nwithout SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the\\ntransmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don\\'t\\nsteal any more cars.  But only if we\\'re given a chance to succeed.\\n\\n          - dan\\n--\\nDan Kohn \\n  \\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: Daniel Quinlan [mailto:quinlan@pathname.com] \\nSent: Wednesday, August 28, 2002 16:38\\nTo: Matthew Cline\\nCc: spamassassin-talk@example.sourceforge.net\\nSubject: Re: [SAtalk] O.T.

I\\n   don\\'t understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,\\n   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,\\n   \"pump and dump\" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly\\n   required for the spammer to get their way.\\n\\nDan\\n\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\nThis sf.net email is sponsored by: Jabber - The world\\'s fastest growing \\nreal-time communications platform!

Some recent research points worth mentioning:\\n\\nRecent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and\\ntemperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest\\ncorrelation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases\\nare not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the\\nincrease in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature\\npreceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done\\nof the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are\\ncorrelated with temperature increases, but are not significantly\\ncausative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in a\\nfairly stable fashion.  I don't believe anyone really has an\\nauthoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet.\\n\\nWith respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to\\npoint out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly\\nregular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.  At previous cycle\\npeaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now.  If this\\ncycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 complete\\ncyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape and\\ntime), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now.  As it\\nhappens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous\\ncyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In other\\nwords, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like we\\nwould be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical\\nrecord.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2\\nconcentrations.\\n\\nAlso, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately\\naffects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely\\npredictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative\\nfeedback systems mentioned above.\\n\\nLast, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it\\nmakes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and\\nmethane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule\\nbasis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something\\nthat CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the\\nbiosphere.\\n\\nCO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent\\nstudies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a\\npassenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.  I certainly don't\\nthink it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested in\\nunderstanding warming trends.\\n\\nCheers,\\n\\n-James Rogers\\n jamesr@best.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"),\n",

He might have dreamed of becoming an\\nace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined\\ntoppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to\\nuse the Internet to end world hunger.\\n\\nBut as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he\\'s harboring\\ndifferent academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do\\nsomething more social and more interesting than working with computers.\\n\\nBesides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, \"you\\ncan\\'t get the chicks with that anymore.\"\\n\\nThe tech industry\\'s financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of\\nsome fair-weather students. But now there\\'s another consequence of the tech\\nbust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has\\ncome to a halt.\\n\\nThe number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in\\n2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And\\neducators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some\\ncolleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.\\n\\nThe word is out among department deans that the bust\\'s fallout has trickled\\ninto the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of\\nComputing Machinery.\\n\\n\"I\\'ve heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic\\ndeclines,\" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering\\nat Princeton University in January. \"It can be hard to see this, because at\\nsome colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far\\nexceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.\"\\n\\nAt Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science\\ndepartment will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington\\nUniversity, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer\\nscience fell by more than half this year.\\n\\nInterest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the\\npast decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and\\ncomputer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing\\nResearch Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees\\nwere awarded.\\n\\nThe Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the\\nfastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other\\ncomputer-related industries trailing close behind.\\n\\nBut in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among\\ncollege students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying\\ninformation technology and engineering at George Mason University were\\ncomputer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is\\ndown to 800, although a newly created and more general information\\ntechnology major has attracted 200 students.\\n\\n\"Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,\" said Lloyd Griffith,\\ndean of George Mason\\'s information technology and engineering school.\\n\"Particularly with the field as it has been, they don\\'t want to spend four\\nyears on something and then not get a job.\"\\n\\nFreshman enrollment for the University of Maryland\\'s computer science major\\nis expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland\\ndecreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does\\nnot account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland\\'s College of\\nComputer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.\\n\\n\"We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their\\ninterest in pursuing computer science as a major,\" Halperin said. \"That\\'s a\\nfactual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don\\'t expect\\nto see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no\\nlonger expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.\"\\n\\nYandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not\\nconvinced that\\'s the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,\\nwith a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his\\nadvanced-placement exam in computer science.\\n\\n\"All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,\\nso I looked for professions in which I could use those things,\" Yandziak\\nsaid. \"I\\'m just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I\\nwant to do something that will contribute to the practical world.\"\\n\\nHarris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of\\nAmerica, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,\\nsalaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.\\n\\n\"There was a tremendous imbalance in the late \\'90s; potentially you have the\\nsame sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, \\'I don\\'t need this\\nkind of IT training right now,\\' \" Miller said. \"Our concern as an industry\\nis that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the\\nroad four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to\\nfind themselves in a shortage situation.\"\\n\\nEconomic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other\\nfactors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social\\ninfluences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional\\ndevelopment at the American College Counseling Association. The perception\\nof computer science as an isolating, \"nerdy\" profession is one that many in\\nthe industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during\\nthe tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.\\n\\n\"All the hipness is gone,\" Yandziak said. \"Once we thought of the Internet\\nas this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that\\ncame along.\"\\n\\nLamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in\\nthe District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business\\nmarketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.\\n\\n\"Technology comes natural to people my age; it\\'s not fascinating anymore,\"\\nThompson said. \"To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I\\nthink of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room.

What she\\ndoesn\\'t have is the meat of the moose she hit and killed with her car on\\nNov. 5, the moose that was rightfully hers, but instead went to a neighbor.\\n\\nThe lack of it has her embroiled in a fight with the York County Sheriff\\'s\\nDepartment to get back what she says she is owed.\\n\\n\"I think the deputy thought he was doing me a favor,\" said Pierce. \"I\\'m a\\nwoman and he just neglected to think that I would want it. The moose is\\ngone, I know that now. I want to be compensated for the meat.\"\\n\\nWhether or not that happens is uncertain. Her experience, though, highlights\\na law some Mainers may not be aware of, but should get to know during this\\npeak time of deer-versus-car accidents, as the animals, in their mating\\nseason, come out of the woods.\\n\\nThe law is simple: A big-game carcass caught by a car - be it a moose, deer\\nor bear - goes to the person who hits it, as long as a law enforcement\\nofficer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident.\\n\\nIt comes up quite often in Maine, say officials. Last year, there were 4,055\\ncases of vehicles and deer colliding on Maine roads and 600 accidents\\ninvolving moose, according to Mark Latti, spokesman for the Maine Warden\\nService.\\n\\n\"In a state of what, 1.4 million, with only 215,000 licensed hunters, I\\ndon\\'t know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out a\\nmoose,\" said Latti. \"You do have the option of keeping it.\"\\n\\nWhich, for some people, can be valuable compensation for a damaged car.\\nFarm-grown deer meat can retail for $8 to $20 per pound in stores. And a\\nbutchered or dressed moose, which can\\'t be bought or sold anywhere in Maine,\\ncan produce hundreds of pounds of food.\\n\\nLatti said when it comes to moose, the law has been abused since its\\ninception in 1991. Every now and then an officer will issue a summons to a\\ndriver for intentionally killing a moose with a car. That kind of \"hunting\"\\nmakes no sense to Latti.\\n\\nHitting a moose, even at a slow speed, is no laughing matter. Large adult\\nmoose can weigh up to 1,500 pounds and can be more than 9 feet tall. Since\\nthe bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars, their bodies\\noften come crashing through windshields in collisions. More often than not,\\ncrashes like these damage the vehicle, the people inside and the animal.\\n\\nSometimes they are fatal. In 1998, Latti said, there were six moose-related\\nfatalities. After that, when the number of moose-hunting permits went from\\n2,000 to 3,000, there were less. Maine had three moose-related fatalities in\\n2000, one in 2001 and two this year so far, said Stephen McCausland,\\nspokesman for the Maine Public Safety Department.\\n\\nPierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car\\ndid not become part of that statistic early on Election Day. But she also\\nfeels cheated by the whole situation. After all, her car was totaled.\\n\\nOn the morning of the accident, Pierce was taking her two children and a\\nneighbor\\'s son to school in her 1991 Dodge Dynasty. She said she was going\\nalong at about 35 mph on a well-traveled road, when a moose came out of\\nnowhere.\\n\\n\"By the time my brain could see moose, he was part of my windshield,\" she\\nsaid. \\n\\nPierce is well aware of the law, so as she sat in the ambulance with the\\nchildren, being treated for cuts and bruises, she thought about the moose.\\nBut the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal\\nwith it, so she said she wasn\\'t able to follow up on the animal until later\\nthat day.\\n\\nWhen she inquired, she was told the deputy on the scene gave the\\nfully-racked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor.\\n\\nHer neighbor, she said, subsequently offered her the moose for the $100 it\\ntook him to carry it away, money she didn\\'t think she should spend. By the\\ntime she contacted the Attorney General\\'s Office on Nov. 12 to complain\\nabout the deputy giving her moose away, the neighbor\\'s price had gone up\\nanother $300 for the cost of butchering 450 pounds of meat.\\n\\nAnd when she called York County Chief Deputy Maurice Ouellette to complain\\nthat she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer\\'s\\nfault that she didn\\'t have it, Ouellette told her he could not give her cash\\nand the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in York\\nCounty.\\n\\n\"At that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore, but\\nwanting money,\" Ouellette said.\\n\\nThat conversation, and a similar one she had with York County Sheriff Phil\\nCote, left Pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the\\nmoose.\\n\\nBut the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to\\nother officials.\\n\\n\"It\\'s the officer\\'s discretion,\" said Latti. \"And if the officer feels the\\nperson can\\'t immediately remove (the animal), he\\'s got to think of public\\nsafety and other people on the roadway. If someone is worried about her\\nchildren in her car, the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask\\nis if she wants the moose.\"\\n\\nMaine State Police Trooper Jeremy Forbes said when he arrives at accidents\\nthat involve a serious injury to a person, the issue of who gets the animal,\\ndeer or moose, becomes secondary.\\n\\n\"The priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital,\" he\\nsaid. \"If they are really hurt and going to the hospital, the animal can\\'t\\nwait, so we\\'ll probably give it to the next person who stops by.\"\\n\\nThis is not comforting to Pierce. She said the deputy could have come to the\\nambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose. With her\\nboyfriend, a hunter, nearby, she could have easily taken care of the animal\\nherself.\\n\\nShe knows her situation is probably a lost cause. But she hopes other\\npeople, especially other women, do not have the same experience.\\n\\n\"What about people who don\\'t know the law?\" she said. \"Standing up for my\\nrights has just been a big headache.\"\\n\\nStaff Writer Giselle Goodman can be contacted at 324-4888 or at:\\n\\nggoodman@pressherald.com\\n\\n\\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\\nforteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com\\n\\n \\n\\nYour use of Yahoo!

              "  \"Raymond L. Wallace, 83\\nBigfoot Story Teller\\n(1919-2002)\\n\\nRay Wallace, a controversial figure involved in 44 years of Bigfoot-related\\nevents, died November 26, 2002, in Toledo, Washington.  The Washington State\\nconstruction tycoon had been ill for some time, living in a Toledo rest\\nhome.\\n\\nIt was at Bluff Creek, California, in 1958, which found Ray Wallace¹s\\ncompany building a new road through the northern California forest.   In\\nAugust through October, Wallace Construction Company's employee Jerry Crew\\nfound tracks of a huge humanlike foot.  Thanks to instructions from\\ntaxidermist Bob Titmus, Crew made the first plaster casts of a footprint\\nfrom this hairy upright creature his fellow workers called ³Bigfoot.²  Crew\\ntook the cast to town, to quiet local ridicule, and showed it to a Humboldt\\nCounty newspaper editor.  The photograph of Jerry Crew with the giant\\nplaster of Paris foot imprint went out over the newswires.   It produced a\\nrevolutionary shift from small regional stories of Sasquatch to today¹s\\nglobal awareness of Bigfoot. Soon after the publicized Crew finds, Wallace\\nand his brother claimed other Bigfoot activity around the construction site;\\nWallace said he found tracks and droppings of Bigfoot.\\n\\nWallace was to be involved with the local tales of hairy giants for the rest\\nof his life.  Allegedly in the later in the 1950s, for example, Wallace\\noffered to sell Texas millionaire Tom Slick a captured Bigfoot.  Wallace\\nfailed to produce the creature when Slick came up with an offer. Down\\nthrough the years, Wallace would carry on pranks, be tied to carved fake\\nSasquatch feet, and produce and try to sell dubious photographs and films.\\nHe was a great letter writer and would pen long passages to magazine editors\\nabout this photographs or telling of how he knew a Bigfoot was nearby\\nguarding a mine full of gold.  After awhile, most Bigfoot hunters and\\nresearchers took Wallace as merely a spinner of fanciful tall tales. Through\\nhis contributions to Strange Magazine, the Track Record, and indirectly to\\nFate Magazine, Wallace relished keeping his name in the limelight of the\\nBigfoot mystery.\\n\\nIn March 1998, Ray Wallace offered a million dollars to the first person who\\ncould bring him a live baby Bigfoot.  Saying he had tracked Bigfoot for\\nforty years, Wallace claimed he wanted to raise a young Sasquatch to\\nadulthood. Wallace told reporters he planned to raise a baby Bigfoot with\\n³care and respect² and would like to train the creature to ride around with\\nhim in his pickup truck and help out with chores around his ranch.  No one\\ncame forth with a baby Bigfoot.\\n\\nRay Wallace added an intriguing, mostly harmless story-telling element to\\nthe otherwise often serious pursuit of Bigfoot that various friends of his,\\nsuch as Ray Crowe, Director of the International Bigfoot Society, enjoyed.\\n\\nRay Wallace was interred at the Lone Hill Cemetery in Toledo, Washington\\nState, on November 30, 2002.\\n\\n©Loren Coleman 2002\\nhttp://www.lorencoleman.com\\n\\n\\nTo unsubscribe from this group, send an email to:\\nforteana-unsubscribe@egroups.com\\n\\n \\n\\nYour use of Yahoo!

Best, \\nRohit\\n\\n===========================================================\\n\\nDataPower delivers XML acceleration device\\nBy\\xa0Scott Tyler Shafer\\nAugust 27, 2002 5:46 am PT\\n\\nDATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed \\nspecifically to process XML data. Unlike competing solutions that \\nprocess XML data in software, DataPower\\'s device processes the data in \\nhardware -- a technology achievement that provides greater performance, \\naccording to company officials.\\n\\nThe new device, dubbed DataPower XA35 XML Accelerator, is the first in a \\nfamily of products expected from the Cambridge, Mass.-based startup. The \\nDataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology \\ncalled XG3 that does the analysis, parsing, and processing of the XML \\ndata.\\n\\nAccording to Steve Kelly, CEO of DataPower, the XA35 Accelerator was \\nconceived to meet the steady adoption of XML, the anticipated future \\nproliferation of Web services, and as a means to share data between two \\nbusinesses.\\n\\n\"Our vision is to build out an XML-aware infrastructure,\" Kelly said. \\n\"The XA35 is the first of a family.\"\\n\\nKelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up \\nto 20 times. This, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on \\napplication servers; DataPower believes an inline device is the best \\nalternative.\\n\\nIn addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount \\nimportance in the world of XML.\\n\\n\"Today\\'s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only,\" Kelly \\nsaid. \"A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall. \\nFirewalls are blind to XML today.\"\\n\\nFuture products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on \\nsecurity, especially as Web services proliferate, Kelly said.\\n\\nAccording to DataPower, most existing solutions to offload XML \\nprocessing are homegrown and done in software -- an approach the company \\nitself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed \\nand security. After trying the software path, the company turned to \\ncreating a solution that would process XML in hardware.\\n\\n\"Our XG3 execution core converts XML to machine code,\" said Kelly, \\nadding that to his knowledge no other company\\'s solution does. Kelly \\nsaid in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with \\ntechnologies that claim to do XML processing -- claims that he believes \\nwill be mostly false.\\nOther content-aware switches, such as SSL (secure socket layer) \\naccelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, \\nwhile the XA35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes \\nand thus enabling greater processing of XML data, Kelly explained.\\n\\nThe 1U-high network device has been tested against a large collection of \\nXML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language \\nas they pass through the device.\\n\\nThe XA35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load \\nbalancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify \\nand process those packets that are XML, Kelly said.\\n\\nIn addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application \\nco-processor. This deployment method gives administrators more granular \\ncontrol over what data is inspected and the application server itself \\ncontrols the device.\\n\\nDataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. Startup \\nSarvega, based in Burr Ridge, Ill., introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in \\nMay, and earlier this month Tarari, an Intel spin-off, launched with a \\nfocus on content processing and acceleration.\\nThe DataPower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. The \\ncompany has announced one customer to date and says the product is in \\nfield trails at a number of other enterprises.\\n\\n=========================================================================\\n\\nDataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was \\nfounded in early 1999 by Eugene Kuznetsov, a technology visionary who \\nforesaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols \\nwould have on enterprise networks. Long before industry interest in XML \\ngrew, Kuznetsov assembled a team of world-class M.I.T. engineers and \\ndesigned the industry\\'s first solutions to address the unique \\nrequirements for processing XML. The first such solution was a software \\ninterpreter called DGXT. This software-based approach to XML processing \\nis still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today.\\n\\nLeveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from \\ndeveloping software-based accelerators, Kuznetsov\\'s team raised the bar \\nand designed a system for processing XML in purpose-built hardware. In \\n2001, DataPower\\'s effort produced XML Generation Three (XG3™), the \\nindustry\\'s fastest technology for XML processing, bar none.\\n\\nToday, XG3™ technology powers the industry\\'s first wire-speed XML \\nnetwork devices, enabling secure, high-speed applications and XML Web \\nServices. While other companies are just now marketing first versions of \\nproducts, DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology, \\nproviding an immediate return on technology investments to \\nindustry-leading customers and partners.\\n\\nDataPower\\'s M.I.T. heritage is complemented by a management team that \\nbrings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, \\ndrawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including \\nAkamai, Argon, Cascade, Castle Networks, Sycamore and Wellfleet.\\n\\n=========================================================================\\n\\nDataPower Technology Secures $9.5 Million in Funding\\n\\nVenrock Associates, Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer \\nin XML-Aware Networking for Web Services\\n\\nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. - July 8, 2002 - DataPower Technology, Inc., the \\nleading provider of XML-Aware network infrastructure, today announced \\nthat it has secured $9.5 million in series B financing.

It is the responsibility of the receiving mail \\nserver to escape lines beginning with \"From \" if they choose to turn on that \\nfacility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the \\nstupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun\\'s even more stupid decision to \\nrely on \"Content-length:\" instead of dealing with this problem.  Since mh is \\nunaware of \"Content-length:\", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the \\nspool.\\n\\nI had this same problem.  There are several ways to fix it:\\n\\n1)  Get your mail administrator to add the \"E\" flag to your sendmail.  This \\nmeans you will never see a line beginning with \"From \".  Any such line will \\nlook like \">From \".\\n\\n2)  There is a patch to mh to make it respect \"Content-length:\".  When I was \\nhaving this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, \\nthen nmh development stalled for a long time.  I doubt it has been done, but \\nyou can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure.\\n\\n3)  You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of \\nletting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.

Those who deny such a watershed event take a\\nsuperficially short-term view, and seem to think all is as before simply\\nbecause the sun still rises and sets.\\n\\nThis is a colossal misjudgment. The collapse of the towers, the crashing\\ninto the Pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 Americans \\x97 all seen live in real\\ntime by millions the world over \\x97 tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds,\\nwhich, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. The killers\\ndealt in icons \\x97 the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the\\nmanifest symbols of global capitalism and American military power, and\\ncentering their destruction on the largest Jewish city in the world. Yes,\\nthey got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing\\nhas instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine.\\n\\nIslamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally\\nrepugnant \\x97 and the worst plague upon the Arab world since the Crusades. By\\nlurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the\\nvampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and\\nbombs; but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 9/11, they prove only\\nghoulish not fearsome.\\n\\nThe more the world knows of al Qaeda and bin Laden, the more it has found\\nthem both vile and yet banal \\x97 and so is confident and eager to eradicate\\nthem and all they stand for. It is one thing to kill innocents, quite\\nanother to take on the armed might of an aroused United States. Easily\\ndodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of Afghanistan may make good\\ntheater and bring about braggadocio; dealing with grim American and British\\ncommandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and\\nan occasional cheap infomercial on the run. And the ultimate consequence of\\nthe attacks of September 11 will not merely be the destruction of al Qaeda,\\nbut also the complete repudiation of the Taliban, the Iranian mullocracy,\\nthe plague of the Pakistani madrassas, and any other would-be fundamentalist\\nparadise on earth.\\n\\nForeign relations will not be the same in our generation. Our coalition with\\nEurope, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic\\nnomenclature and the mutual back scratching of Euro-American globetrotters \\x97\\na paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the Cold\\nWar. The truth is that Europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has\\ninsidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an\\nantidemocratic EU, a 80,000-person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power\\nis as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often\\ndubious international accords. This sad realization September 11 brutally\\nexposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the\\nmoment completely lost its moral bearings. Indeed, as the months progressed\\nthe problems inherent in \"the European way\" became all too apparent:\\npretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract\\nmoralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and\\nconstant American ankle-biting even as Europe lives in a make-believe Shire\\nwhile we keep back the forces of Mordor from its picturesque borders, with\\nonly a few brave Frodos and Bilbos tagging along. Nothing has proved more\\nsobering to Americans than the skepticism of these blinkered European\\nhobbits after September 11.\\n\\nAmerica learned that \"moderate\" Arab countries are as dangerous as hostile\\nIslamic nations. After September 11, being a Saudi, Egyptian, or Kuwaiti\\nmeans nothing special to an American \\x97 at least not proof of being any more\\nfriendly or hostile than having Libyan, Syrian, or Lebanese citizenship.\\nIndeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of\\ntheir anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases \\x97 like NATO \\x97 belongs to a\\npre-9/11 age of Soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. Now we learn\\nthat broadcasting state-sponsored hatred of Israel and the United States is\\njust as deadly to our interests as scud missiles \\x97 and as likely to come\\nfrom friends as enemies. Worst-case scenarios like Iran and Afghanistan\\noffer more long-term hope than \"stable regimes\" like the Saudis; governments\\nthat hate us have populations that like us \\x97 and vice versa; the Saudi royal\\nfamily, whom 5,000 American troops protect, and the Mubarak autocracy, which\\nhas snagged billions of American dollars, are as afraid of democratic\\nreformers as they are Islamic fundamentalists. And with good reason: Islamic\\ngovernments in Iran and under the Taliban were as hated by the masses as\\nArab secular reformers in exile in the West are praised and championed.\\n\\nThe post-9/11 domestic calculus is just as confusing. Generals and the\\nmilitary brass call civilians who seek the liberation of Iraq \"chicken\\nhawks\" and worse. Yet such traditional Vietnam-era invective I think rings\\nhollow after September 11, and sounds more like McClellan\\'s shrillness\\nagainst his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery\\nended than resonant of Patton\\'s audacity in charging after murderous Nazis.\\nMore Americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those\\nsoldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of Vietnam nearly 30\\nyears ago. Indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of\\nVietnam are now in or nearing retirement; and, thank God, there is no\\ngeneration of Americans in the present military \\x97 other than a few thousand\\nbrave veterans of the Gulf, Mogadishu, and Panama \\x97 who have been in\\nsustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. Because American\\nsoldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security\\nis lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in\\nlower Manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the\\nPentagon or CIA than be at sea on a sub or destroyer.\\n\\nReal concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than\\nrejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad\\nas our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at\\nhome. It seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into\\nharm\\'s way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect\\nthousands in high-rises.\\n\\nPolitics have been turned upside down. In the old days, cynical\\nconservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes\\nrepellent Realpolitik. In the age of Russian expansionism, they were loathe\\nto champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist Trojan Horse whose\\nbelly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. Thus they were\\nso often at loggerheads with naïve and idealist leftists.\\n\\nNo longer. The end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive Soviet\\nCommunism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. Champions\\nof freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise\\nopen economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the Russians. Instead,\\neven reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in\\nthe Middle East than are dour and skeptical leftists. The latter, if\\nmulticulturalists, often believe that democracy is a value-neutral Western\\nconstruct, not necessarily a universal good; if pacifists, they claim\\nnonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. The Right, not the\\nLeft, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and\\nidealism \\x97 with obvious domestic ramifications for any Republican president\\nastute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support.\\n\\nAll this and more are the wages of the disaster of September 11 and the\\nsubsequent terrible year \\x97 and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we\\nwill see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Seated in this \"\\nbowl \", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground\\nwith wooden plugs, one in each hand.\\n\\nBilly\\'s unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been\\nborn without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing\\nhim with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an\\nunusually handsome face.\\n\\nThis was Billy\\'s greatest asset in his daily routine of separating\\nsympathetic passers-by from their small change.\\n\\nThe cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many\\nlonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century\\nGrangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would\\ncome along.\\n\\nHe would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his\\nblack curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a\\nhandsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.\\n\\n\"Billy in the Bowl\", however, wasn\\'t satisfied with becoming the daily\\nowner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were\\nsubstantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could\\nindulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.\\n\\nAs a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.\\nThe first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening\\nas dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing\\nthrough Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on\\nDublin\\'s North Quays.\\n\\nWhen Billy heard the woman\\'s footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a\\nditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the\\nbeggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.\\n\\nTrembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay\\nconcealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two\\npowerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.\\n\\nIn a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy\\nwas travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his \" bowl \", his victirn\\'s\\npurse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was\\nfound in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her\\nassailant.  And, as \"Billy in the Bowl\" had figured, nobody would suspect a\\ndeformed beggar.\\n\\nAgain and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting\\nthe place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.\\n\\nOn one occasion \" Billy in \"the Bowl \" tried his tactics on a sturdy\\nservant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to\\nstrangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder\\nand caused a great stir.\\n\\nHundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months\\n\"Billy in the Bowl\" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this\\nperiod, Dublin\\'s first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first\\ncase they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.\\n\\nMonths passed and  \"Billy in the Bowl\" reverted once again to his old\\npasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and\\nrobbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a\\nnightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled\\nalong in his \"bowl\" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that\\nfinished Billy\\'s career of crime.\\n\\nTwo stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment\\nafter a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to\\nhear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the\\nditch.\\n\\nBilly, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and\\ntried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,\\nhowever) and while resisting tore \\'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.\\n\\nMeanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her\\nlarge hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.\\n\\nThe screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the\\ndistrict and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member\\nof the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.\\n\\n\"Billy in the Bowl\" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but\\nthey could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The\\nGrangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive\\nDublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed\\nand giggled as they wended their way home at night.\\n\\n\\n\\ndaev\\n\\n_______________________________\\nRev.

However, the people\\n behind it have not been caught. \\n \\n NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. \\n \\n The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many\\n other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. \\n\\n Domain games \\n \\n Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or\\n 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any\\n cash successfully moved out of Africa. \\n \\n The \\'419\\' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such\\n crimes. \\n \\n Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking\\n the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe\\n uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. \\n \\n Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to\\n it. \\n \\n NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in\\n London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. \\n \\n Cutting edge fraud \\n \\n Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of\\n legitimacy. \\n \\n \\n People tricked into clicking on fake sites\\n \\n But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in\\n place of the certificates. \\n \\n \"To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web\\n technology,\" said the spokesman. \\n \\n One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website\\n that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African\\n Reserve Bank, the country\\'s national bank. \\n \\n Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to\\n visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has\\n been deposited in their name. \\n \\n But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically\\n asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. \\n \\n Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national\\n priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. \\n \\n Modern gloss \\n \\n An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that\\n criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give\\n old cons a modern gloss. \\n \\n The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come\\n forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two\\n months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. \\n \\n He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be\\n true, undoubtedly is. \\n \\n One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment\\n service Paypal. \\n \\n Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account\\n and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. \\n \\n The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed\\n people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen\\'s personal use. \\n\\n\\n------------------------ Yahoo!

And the bandwidth shadows in most cities\\nare surprisingly large and common.  They aren\\'t selling the software, which\\nis pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next\\ngeneration wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large\\nscale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless\\nconfigurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and\\nothers which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit\\nconsiderations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize\\nthe canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless\\nis tied into fiber at multiple points.\\n\\nThe canopies we are talking about aren\\'t short-range wifi technologies, but\\na mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth\\nmeasured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to\\nwell over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and\\nbandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an\\norder of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and\\nproximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the\\ncost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers\\ncan remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low\\nbar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of\\nlarge-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective\\nbandwidth available per unit area) in any case.

It took two hours to find her.\\n\\nALB> \"The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all\\nALB> my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,\" he said. \"I\\nALB> knew then there was something special.\"\\n\\nALB> Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet\\nALB> -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,\\nALB> who is expecting their first child.\\n\\nALB> Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women\\nALB> in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that\\nALB> often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand\\nALB> in search of a wife.\\n\\nALB> \"I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I\\'d met Wan,\" he said. \"I knew I\\nALB> found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.\"\\n\\nALB> Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in\\nALB> touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and\\nALB> the couple married.\\n\\nALB> MR. MARRIAGE\\n\\nALB> Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency\\nALB> Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself \"Mr. Marriage,\"\\nALB> started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction\\nALB> agency.\\n\\nALB> Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.\\n\\nALB> \"In the last five years we\\'ve done about 400,\" he said. \"To the best of my\\nALB> knowledge, they have all been successful.\"\\n\\nALB> Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that\\nALB> require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.\\nALB> Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women\\nALB> looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.\\n\\nALB> Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch\\'s\\nALB> office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and\\nALB> language problems.\\n\\nALB> \"We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,\"\\nALB> Lynch said. \"But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.\"\\n\\nALB> After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know\\nALB> each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every\\nALB> client has found a potential wife.\\n\\nALB> \"At the end of a fortnight it\\'s very, very rare for a guy to go back and\\nALB> think he hasn\\'t made his mind up,\" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,\\nALB> usually within the next year.\\n\\nALB> Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a\\nALB> Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less\\nALB> than 10 percent have broken up.\\n\\nALB> Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just\\nALB> arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.\\n\\nALB> \"Sometimes they are very nervous,\" she said. \"And sometimes they are very\\nALB> impatient and say \\'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.\\' I say: \\'Calm\\nALB> down, OK, we\\'ll talk.\"\\'\\n\\nALB> But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife\\nALB> and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives\\nALB> for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic\\nALB> stress disorder.\\n\\nALB> WHY?\\n\\nALB> Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics\\nALB> say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to\\nALB> form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of\\nALB> impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.\\n\\nALB> But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is\\nALB> no reason to object. \"If you talk about people who are needy, I think\\nALB> everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I\\nALB> need Wan,\" he said.\\n\\nALB> \"Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there\\'s no\\nALB> secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don\\'t have a problem\\nALB> with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to\\nALB> their future husband.\"\\n\\nALB> Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they\\nALB> choose to use his agency.\\n\\nALB> His brochure promises an alternative to the \"kind of de-feminized,\\nALB> over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British\\nALB> singles scene,\" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are\\nALB> not \"God\\'s gift to women.\"\\n\\nALB> Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their\\nALB> own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.\\n\\nALB> \"They don\\'t know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques\\nALB> or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?\\nALB> Impossible,\" she said.\\n\\nALB> \"Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are\\nALB> good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from\\nALB> ladies from other countries.\"\\n\\nALB> Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,\\nALB> the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also\\nALB> not a major obstacle.\\n\\nALB> \"Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having\\nALB> a husband who is significantly older,\" Lynch said. \"When I met my wife she\\nALB> couldn\\'t speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic\\nALB> dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up\\nALB> very quickly.\"\\n\\nALB> Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move\\nALB> to the West.\\n\\nALB> \"We have kitchens, we have study classes,\" Roongthip said. \"We teach them\\nALB> how to eat, and when to make tea.\"\\n\\nALB> PITFALLS\\n\\nALB> But not all dreams come true. \"Bee\" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to\\nALB> Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is\\nALB> back in Bangkok, sad and angry.\\n\\nALB> \"He had no friends, and I was so lonely,\" she said. \"I tried to make him\\nALB> happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never\\nALB> spoke to me.\"\\n\\nALB> Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. \"I thought I would be happy\\nALB> there,\" she said. \"But it was the worst time of my life.\"\\n\\nALB> Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure\\nALB> unsuitable candidates are weeded out.\\n\\nALB> \"We are ethical and professional,\" he said. \"We will not take on all\\nALB> comers.\"\\n\\nALB> Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the\\nALB> arrangement can work. Wan\\'s sister has just signed up with Lynch\\'s company,\\nALB> looking for a foreign husband.\\n\\nALB> \"Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited.

For the country\\'s fast-growing population of \\nInternet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving \\nan elusive creature. Earlier this month, the Chinese authorities blocked \\naccess to Google from Internet service providers in China—apparently \\nbecause the search engine helped Chinese users to get access to \\nforbidden sites. Now, after an outcry from those users, access has been \\nrestored.\\n\\nAn unusual climbdown by China\\'s zealous Internet censors? Hardly. More \\nsophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to \\nuse Google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. \\nAccess is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by \\nGoogle as it trawls the Internet. These once provided a handy way for \\nChinese users to see material stored on blocked websites.\\n\\nAfter the blocking of Google on August 31st, many Chinese Internet users \\nposted messages on bulletin boards in China protesting against the move. \\nTheir anger was again aroused last week when some Chinese Internet \\nproviders began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked Google site \\nto far less powerful search engines in China.\\n\\nDuncan Clark, the head of a Beijing-based technology consultancy firm, \\nBDA (China) Ltd, says China is trying a new tactic in its efforts to \\ncensor the Internet. Until recently, it had focused on blocking \\nindividual sites, including all pages stored on them. Now it seems to be \\nfiltering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key \\nwords that might indicate undesirable content. For example earlier this \\nweek when using Eastnet, a Beijing-based Internet provider, a search on \\nGoogle for Falun Gong—a quasi-Buddhist exercise sect outlawed in China—\\nusually aborted before all the results had time to appear.

I was shocked. What about Gettysburg \\nand the Declaration of Independence and the Selma-to-Montgomery march? \\nJust look at my textbook, he said, and when I did I saw his point. His \\nclass had got up to the eighteen-forties. What I expected was a big \\nbeefing up of the roles of Sacagawea and Crispus Attucks, and, in-deed, \\nthere was some of that. But the main difference between my son\\'s text \\nand that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous \\ndecision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in American \\nhistory. There were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and \\nreciprocal trade agreements. I skipped ahead, past the Civil War, hoping \\nfor easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation \\nof freight rates. Only a few decades into the twentieth century did it \\nbecome possible to see the federal government\\'s main function as \\nresponding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, \\ninstead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic \\ninterests.\\n\\nEven now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty \\nspeeches and the sanctimonious hearings in Washington, what you\\'d find \\nis thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so \\nmuch over the public as over each other: agribusiness versus real \\nestate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. The arena in which \\nthis competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and \\ncommissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. It\\'s \\nan insider\\'s game, less because the players are secretive than because \\nthe public and the press—encouraged by the players, who speak in jargon—\\ncan\\'t get themselves interested.\\n\\nOne corner of Washington might be called F.C.C. World, for the Federal \\nCommunications Commission. F.C.C. World has perhaps five thousand \\ndenizens. They work at the commission itself, at the House and Senate \\ncommerce committees, and at the Washington offices of the companies that \\nthe commission regulates. They read Communications Daily (subscription \\nprice: $3,695 a year), and every year around Christmastime they \\ngrumblingly attend the Chairman\\'s Dinner, at a Washington hotel, where \\nthe high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly self-deprecating \\ncomedy routine by the commission\\'s chairman.\\n\\nOf all the federal agencies and commissions, the F.C.C. is the one that \\nAmericans ought to be most interested in; after all, it is involved with \\na business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the \\nAmerican economy, as well as important aspects of daily life—telephone \\nand television and radio and newspapers and the Internet. And right now \\nF.C.C. World is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, \\nbecause a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the \\n\"corporate scandals\" concerns the economic collapse of companies \\nregulated by the F.C.C. Qwest, WorldCom, Adelphia, and Global Crossing, \\namong others, are (or were) part of F.C.C. World. AOL Time Warner is \\npart of F.C.C. World. Jack Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney \\nanalyst who seems to have succeeded Kenneth Lay, of Enron, as the \\nembodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of F.C.C. World. In the \\npast two years, companies belonging to F.C.C. World have lost trillions \\nof dollars in stock-market valuation, and have collectively served as a \\ndead weight pulling down the entire stock market.\\n\\nThis year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state \\nof the F.C.C. has been circulating widely within F.C.C. World. It evokes \\nF.C.C. World\\'s feverish mood (\"The F.C.C. is fiddling while Rome burns\") \\nand suggests why nobody besides residents of F.C.C. World has thought of \\nthe commission in connection with the corporate scandals. The sentence I \\njust quoted is followed by this explanation: \"The ILECs appear likely to \\nenter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no \\nresidential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% \\nmarket share loss in business lines to CLECs.\" It\\'s a lot easier to \\nthink about evil C.E.O.s than to decipher that.\\n\\n\\nEven in good times, F.C.C. World pays obsessive attention to the \\ncommission\\'s chairman. In bad times, the attention becomes especially \\nintense; and when the chairman is a celebrity F.C.C. World devotes \\nitself to full-time chairman-watching. The current chairman, Michael \\nPowell, is a celebrity, at least by government-official standards, \\nbecause he is the only son of Colin Powell, the Secretary of State. \\nUnlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which \\ngenerates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about \\nwho he really is and what he\\'s really up to. Powell is young to be the \\nhead of a federal agency—he is thirty-nine—and genially charming. \\nEverybody likes him. Before becoming chairman, he was for three years \\none of the F.C.C.\\'s five commissioners; not only is he fluent in the \\nF.C.C.\\'s incomprehensible patois, he has a Clintonesque love of the \\narcane details of communications policy. He\\'s always saying that he\\'s an \\n\"avid moderate.\" And yet he has a rage-inciting quality. One of his \\npredecessors as chairman, Reed Hundt, quoted in Forbes, compared Powell \\nto Herbert Hoover. Mark Cooper, of the Consumer Federation of America, \\ncalls him \"radical and extreme.\" Just as often as he\\'s accused of being \\na right-wing ideologue, Powell gets accused of being paralytically \\ncautious. \"It ain\\'t about singing \\'Kum-Ba-Yah\\' around the campfire,\" \\nanother former chairman, William Kennard, says. \"You have to have an \\nanswer.\" One day last spring, Powell, testifying before a Senate \\nsubcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the \\nsubcommittee\\'s chairman, Ernest Hollings, of South Carolina, berated \\nhim. \"You don\\'t care about these regulations,\" Hollings said. \"You don\\'t \\ncare about the law or what Congress sets down. . . . That\\'s the \\nfundamental. That\\'s the misgiving I have of your administration over \\nthere. It just is amazing to me. You just pell-mell down the road and \\nseem to not care at all. I think you\\'d be a wonderful executive \\nvice-president of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a \\nregulatory commission at the government level. Are you happy in your \\njob?\"\\n\\n\"Extremely,\" Powell said, with an amiable smile.\\n\\n\\nOne cannot understand Powell\\'s maddening effect, at least on Democrats \\nand liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose \\nof the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. The F.C.C. was \\ncreated by Congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the \\nNew Deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy \\ncases for government intervention in the private economy: making sure \\nthat broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. Its \\nother original function was preventing American Telephone & Telegraph, \\nthe national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers \\nunfairly. Over the decades, as F.C.C. World grew up into a comfortable, \\nwell-established place, the F.C.C. segued into the role of industrial \\nsupervision—its real purpose. It was supposed to manage the competition \\namong communications companies so that it didn\\'t become too bloody, by \\nartfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. \\nIn addition to looking out for the public\\'s interest, the commission \\nmore specifically protected the interests of members of Congress, many \\nof whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most \\nterrifying category of interest group—you can cross the local bank \\npresident and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. \\nAccording to an oft-told F.C.C. World anecdote, President Clinton once \\nblocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers \\nin the same city because, he said, if the so-and-so who owned the \\nanti-Clinton Little Rock Democrat-Gazette had owned the leading TV \\nstation in Little Rock, too, Clinton would never have become President.\\n\\n\\nF.C.C. World may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, \\nbecause all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic \\nniches for themselves. Then, in the nineteen-eighties, the successful \\nbreakup of A.T. & T.—by far the biggest and most important company the \\ncommission regulated—deposited a thick additional sediment of \\nself-confidence onto the consciousness of F.C.C. World. A generation \\nago, for most Americans, there was one local phone company, one \\nlong-distance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, \\nwhich customers were not permitted to own—and they were all the same \\ncompany. It was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. By the \\nmid-nineteen-nineties, there were a dozen economically viable local \\nphone companies, a handful of national long-distance companies competing \\nto offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores \\neverywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturers—and \\nmillions of Americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the \\ntelephone lines. A.T. & T. had argued for years that it was a \"natural \\nmonopoly,\" requiring protection from economic competition and total \\ncontrol over its lines. So much for that argument. Over the same period, \\nthe F.C.C. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones \\nand the Internet. It was the dream of federal-agency success come true: \\nconsumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more \\nprosperous, too.\\n\\nThe next big step was supposed to be the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \\none of those massive, endlessly lobbied-over pieces of legislation which \\nmost people outside F.C.C. World probably felt it was safe to ignore. \\nAlthough the Telecom Act sailed under the rhetorical banner of \\nmodernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interest-group \\nbargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers \\nas \"baby Bells\" and to F.C.C. World as \"arbocks\" (the pronounced version \\nof RBOCs, or regional Bell operating companies), would be permitted to \\noffer long-distance service in exchange for letting the long-distance \\ncompanies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for \\ncustomers. Consumers would win, because for the first time they would \\nget the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more \\ncompetition than they already had in long distance. But the politics and \\neconomics of the Telecom Act (which was shepherded through Congress by \\nVice-President Gore) were just as important. Democrats saw the act as \\nhelping to reposition them as the technology party—the party that \\nbrought the Internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of \\njobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose \\nbeneficiaries might become the party\\'s new contributor base. Clinton\\'s \\nslogans about the \"information superhighway\" and \"building a bridge to \\nthe twenty-first century,\" which, like all Clinton slogans, artfully \\nsent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical \\ncorrelates of the Telecom Act, and Gore\\'s cruise to the Presidency was \\nsupposed to be powered substantially by the act\\'s success.\\n\\nThe F.C.C. had a crucial role in all this. The arbocks are rich, \\naggressive, politically powerful, and generally Republican (though like \\nall important interest groups they work with both parties); they \\nimmediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new \\ncompetitors in the local phone market for more than three years. Through \\nrule-making, enforcement, and litigation, the F.C.C., then headed by \\nReed Hundt, who was Gore\\'s classmate at St. Albans, was supposed to keep \\nthe arbocks in their cages, so that not only long-distance companies \\nlike A.T. & T. and MCI WorldCom but also a whole category of new \\ncompanies, \"see-lecks\" (the pronounced version of CLECs, or competitive \\nlocal exchange carriers), could emerge. This entailed the regulatory \\nequivalent of hand-to-hand combat: the see-leck is supposed to have \\naccess to the arbock\\'s switching equipment, the arbock won\\'t give the \\nseeleck a key to the room where it\\'s kept, so the see-leck asks the \\nF.C.C. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.\\n\\nPartly because Hundt assured the see-lecks and other new companies that \\nhe would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming \\ncondition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the \\nsee-lecks—companies with names like Winstar, Covad, and Teligent—and \\ninto other telecommunications companies. Even not obviously related \\ntechnology companies like Cisco Systems benefitted from the telecom \\nboom: demand for their products was supposed to come from the see-lecks \\nand other new players. There would be no conflict between the interests \\nof the new telecom companies and those of consumers; as one of Hundt\\'s \\nformer lieutenants told me, \"Reed used to joke that my job was to make \\nsure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.\"\\n\\n\\nThe years following the passage of the Telecom Act were the peak of the \\nboom. Wall Street had its blood up, and that meant not just more \\nstartups but also more mergers of existing communications companies: \\nTime Warner and AOL decided to throw in together, and A.T. & T. and \\nComcast, and so on. (Surely, WorldCom and the other telecom bad guys \\nbelieved that their self-dealing, stock-overselling, and creative \\naccounting would go unnoticed because the market was so \\nundiscriminating.)\\n\\nBy the time the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election had been \\ndetermined, the telecom crash was well under way. Nonetheless, the \\nchairmanship of the F.C.C. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of \\ninfluence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. \\nThree Republicans emerged as candidates: Powell, who was a commissioner; \\nHarold Furchtgott-Roth, the farthest-to-the-right commissioner; and \\nPatrick Wood, the head of the Texas Public Utility Commission and, as \\nsuch, a George W. Bush guy. In Texas, however, Wood had crossed the most \\npowerful person in the arbock camp, Edward Whitacre, the C.E.O. of \\nS.B.C. Communications, which is headquartered in San Antonio. This meant \\nthat the arbocks didn\\'t want Wood as head of the F.C.C., because he \\nmight be too pro-see-leck. (Wood is now the head of the Federal Energy \\nRegulatory Commission.) Michael Powell had to signal the arbocks that he \\nwasn\\'t as threatening as Wood, while also signalling the conservative \\nmovement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than \\nFurchtgott-Roth.\\n\\nPowell did this deftly. For example, in December of 2000 he appeared \\nbefore a conservative group called the Progress & Freedom Foundation and \\ngave a very Michael Powell speech—whimsical, intellectual, and \\nfree-associative (Biblical history, Joseph Schumpeter, Moore\\'s Law)—that \\nbegan by making fun of the idea that the F.C.C. should try to keep new \\ntelecom companies alive. \"In the wake of the 1996 Act, the F.C.C. is \\noften cast as the Grinch who stole Christmas,\" Powell said. \"Like the \\nWhos, down in Who-ville, who feast on Who-pudding and rare Who-roast \\nbeast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the \\nderegulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the Act\\'s \\nfertile soil. But this feast the F.C.C. Grinch did not like in the \\nleast, so it is thought.\" Thus Powell was indicating that if he became \\nchairman he didn\\'t expect to administer first aid to the see-lecks as \\npart of the job. He was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day \\nof the Bush Administration.\\n\\nTwenty months into the Administration, nearly all the see-lecks are dead \\nor dying; nearly all long-distance companies, not just WorldCom, are in \\nserious trouble; cable companies have lost half their value; satellite \\ncompanies are staggering. The crash has had an automatically \\nconcentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing \\ncompanies\\' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in \\ngood shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged \\ncompanies at bargain prices. During the Bush Administration, as the \\nfinancial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications \\nindustry has moved in the direction of more concentration. If the Bells \\nwind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and \\nif they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national \\nduopoly in local service: Verizon, in the East, and S.B.C., in the West. \\nAnd these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the \\npoor health of the long-distance companies.\\n\\nThe cable business also seems close to having two dominant national \\ncompanies, AOL Time Warner and Comcast. Unlike the phone companies, they \\ndon\\'t have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more \\nfully control what material they allow to enter people\\'s homes. As part \\nof the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 \\nTelecom Act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were \\nsignificantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of \\nradio-station owners in the United States has been cut by twenty-five \\nper cent; today, a large portion of local and national radio news \\nprogramming is supplied by a single company, Westwood One, a subsidiary \\nof Viacom.\\n\\nIn this situation, many Democrats and liberals think, the F.C.C. should \\nbe hyperactive—the superhero of government regulation, springing to the \\nrescue of both consumers and the communications industry. It should try \\nto breathe life into the see-lecks and other new companies. It should \\ndisallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the \\nforces of concentration. It should use the government\\'s money and muscle \\nto get new technology—especially fast Internet connections—into the \\nhomes of people who can\\'t afford it at current market prices. (An \\nanalogy that a lot of people in F.C.C. World make is between telecom and \\nthe Middle East: the Clinton people blame the bloodshed on the Bush \\npeople, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the Bush \\npeople blame it on the Clinton people, because they raised too many \\nexpectations and stirred too many passions.)\\n\\nBut Michael Powell\\'s F.C.C. has not been hyperactive. Powell has been \\nconducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the \\nF.C.C. and waiting for the federal courts and the Congress to send him \\nsignals. (In mid-September, Powell finally initiated a formal review of \\nthe F.C.C.\\'s limits on media concentration.) This doesn\\'t mean he has \\nbeen inactive; rather, he has been active in a way that further \\ninfuriates his critics—in a manner that smoothly blends the genial and \\nthe provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of \\nF.C.C. World really make sense, while giving the impression that he\\'s \\nhaving the time of his life as chairman. At his first press conference, \\nwhen he was asked what he was going to do about the \"digital \\ndivide\"—that is, economic inequality in access to the Internet—he said, \\n\"You know, I think there is a Mercedes divide. I\\'d like to have one and \\nI can\\'t afford one.\" At the National Cable & Telecommunications \\nAssociation convention, in Chicago, Powell, following a troupe of \\ntumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a \\nsomersault.\\n\\n\\nNot long ago, I went to see Powell in his office at the F.C.C. Until \\n1998, when the commission moved to a new building in Southwest \\nWashington, near the city\\'s open-air fish market, F.C.C. World was at \\nthe western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody \\nelse at a few familiar restaurants and bars. Today, the F.C.C. building \\nlooks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. \\nEven the chairman\\'s suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and \\nfluorescent. Powell is a bulky man who wears gold-rimmed glasses and \\nwalks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a \\njeep accident in Germany, in 1987, when he was an Army officer. Because \\nof the accident, he left the Army and went to law school, where he \\nbecame entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly \\nthe idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of \\nthe market before the fact—\"prophylactically,\" as he likes to say—should \\nwait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust \\nlitigation to fix them. He worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and \\nthen became a protégé of Joel Klein, the head of the antitrust division \\nof the Clinton Justice Department and the man who led the government\\'s \\nlegal case against Microsoft. (He was recently appointed chancellor of \\nthe New York public-school system.) It testifies to Powell\\'s political \\nskill that he is probably the only high official in the Bush \\nAdministration who not only served in the Clinton Administration but \\nalso maintains close ties to Bush\\'s nemesis Senator John McCain, of \\nArizona. One of the things about Powell that annoy people is his \\nenduring love of law school—\"It\\'s sort of like a law-school study \\nsession over there,\" one Democratic former commissioner said. As if to \\nconfirm the charge, Powell, when I arrived, introduced me to four law \\nstudents, summer interns at the commission, whom he\\'d invited to sit in.\\n\\nI began by asking Powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions \\nof the F.C.C. For example, could private companies have apportioned the \\nairwaves among themselves without the government being involved?\\n\\n\"I think we\\'ll never know,\" Powell said. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s an \\nautomatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. Land is probably \\nthe best analogue. We don\\'t seize all the land in the United States and \\nsay, \\'The government will issue licenses to use land.\\' If my neighbor \\nputs a fence one foot onto my property line, there\\'s a whole body of law \\nabout what I can do about that, including whether I can tear it down. If \\na wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it\\'s a \\nsimilar proposition. There are scholars who argue—indeed, the famous \\nRonald Coase treatise that won the Nobel Prize was about this—that \\nspectrum policy is lunacy. The market could work this out, in the kinds \\nof ways that we\\'re accustomed to.\"\\n\\nTalking to Powell was fun. Unlike most high government officials, he \\ndoesn\\'t seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. He \\nslumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. He speaks in \\nironic air quotes. He\\'s like your libertarian friend in college who \\nenjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions \\nabout aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he \\nsees as sentimental or illogical. After a while, I asked him whether he \\nthought his predecessors\\' excitement about the 1996 Telecommunications \\nAct had been excessive.\\n\\n\"I would start with a caveat,\" Powell said. \"Look, I can\\'t fault those \\njudgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. \\nThey were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. \\nBut, frankly, I\\'ve always been a little bit critical. First of all, \\nanybody who works with the act knows that it doesn\\'t come anywhere close \\nto matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the President \\non down, about the kinds of things it\\'s going to open up. I mean, I \\ndon\\'t know what provisions are the information-superhighway provisions, \\nor what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that \\nwere a big part of the theatre of its introduction. When one starts \\nreading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. \\nBut, nonetheless, there was a rising dot-com excitement, and an Internet \\nexcitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it \\ncertainly was.\\n\\n\"But. We were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of \\nexpectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the \\neconomy or the market even gets in trouble. It was a dramatically \\nexaggerated expectation—by the leadership of the commission, by \\npoliticians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. It was a \\ngold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones \\nthat government encouraged by its policies, frankly. Everybody wanted to \\nsee numbers go up on the board.\"\\n\\nPowell began imitating an imagined true believer in the Telecom Act. \" \\n\\'I want to see ten competitors. Twenty competitors! I want to see \\nthirty-per-cent market share. Fifty-per-cent market share! I want the \\nBells to bleed! Then we\\'ll know we\\'ve succeeded.\\' \" Now Powell returned \\nto being Powell. \"I think that expectation was astonishingly \\nunrealistic, in the short term. They wanted to see it while they\\'re \\nthere. We were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. And \\nthe market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. There\\'s no \\nquestion, we went too soon too fast. Too many companies took on too much \\ndebt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business \\nmodel.\"\\n\\nHow could the Telecom Act have been handled better? \"We could have \\nchosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were \\nslightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,\" \\nPowell said. \"Money chased what seemed like government-promised \\nopportunity. The problem with that is there\\'s a morning after, and we\\'re \\nin it. And the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. This \\ndebt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. In some \\nways, for short-term gain, we paid a price in long-term stability.\"\\n\\nPowell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there \\nhad been a more \"reasonable\" level of investment. \"No, we wouldn\\'t have \\nevery home in America with competitive choice yet—but we don\\'t anyway. I \\ndon\\'t think it\\'s the remonopolization of telephone service. I don\\'t buy \\nthat. The Bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn\\'t? The \\npart of the story that didn\\'t materialize was that people thought so \\nwould MCI WorldCom and Sprint.\"\\n\\nOther local phone companies, he added, hadn\\'t materialized as viable \\nbusinesses, either, and they never might. \"Everybody\\'s always saying, \\n\\'The regulators did this and this and this.\\' But, candidly, the story\\'s \\nquite the opposite. I think the regulators bent over backward for six \\nyears to give them a chance. Conditions don\\'t get that good except once \\nevery thirty years, and it didn\\'t happen. So, whatever the reason, we\\'re \\nlooking at a WorldCom that\\'s teetering. We\\'re looking at a long-distance \\nbusiness that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. A.T. & T. is \\nbreaking itself up. Sprint has struggled.\"\\n\\nCould the F.C.C. have done anything to make the long-distance companies \\nstronger? \"At the F.C.C.? I think I\\'ll just be blunt. My political \\nanswer? Yes, there\\'s all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try \\nto help. But I can\\'t find thirty billion dollars for WorldCom somewhere. \\nI can\\'t mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an S.E.C. \\ninvestigation. Were I king, it would be wonderful, but I don\\'t have \\nthose kinds of levers. I don\\'t know whether anybody does. At some point, \\ncompanies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from \\ndying.\" Powell couldn\\'t have made it much clearer that he doesn\\'t think \\nit\\'s his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. He has \\ndemonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist \\ngestures—in August, for example, five months after disbanding the \\nF.C.C.\\'s Accounting Safeguards Division, Powell announced that he was \\nappointing a committee to study accounting standards in the \\ncommunications industry. But that shows that Powell is better at riding \\nout the storm than, say, Harvey Pitt, his counterpart at the Securities \\nand Exchange Commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore \\nup the telecom industry.\\n\\nI asked Powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one \\ncompany provided cable television and only one provided local phone \\nservice. \"Yes,\" he said. \"It concerns us that there\\'s one of each of \\nthose things, but let\\'s not diminish the importance of there being one \\nof each of those things. That still is a nice suite of communications \\ncapabilities, even if they aren\\'t direct analogues of each other.\" \\nAnyway, Powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to \\nprovide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will \\nprovide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. \\n\"So, yeah, we have this anxiety: we have one of everything. The question \\nis, Does it stay that way?\"\\n\\nThe concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of \\ninformation did not appear to trouble Powell, either. He said that \\npeople confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, \\nwhich distorts markets. \"If this were just economics, it\\'s easy. If you \\nwere to say to me, \\'Mike, just worry about economic concentration,\\' we \\nknow how to do that—the econometrics of antitrust. I can tell you when a \\nmarket\\'s too concentrated and prices are going to rise. The problem is \\nother dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. Take \\nthe question of, if everybody\\'s controlling what you see, the assumption \\nthere is that somehow there\\'ll be this viewpoint, a monolithic \\nviewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won\\'t get diversity. I \\nthink that\\'s a possibility. I don\\'t think it\\'s nearly the possibility \\nthat\\'s ascribed to it sometimes.\"\\n\\nPowell explained, \"Sometimes when we see very pointed political or \\nparochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. I see some of the \\nsame people who claim they want diversity go crazy when Rush Limbaugh \\nexists. They love diversity, but somehow we should run Howard Stern off \\nthe planet. If it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, \\nand then we have policies like\"—here his tone went from ironic to \\nsarcastic—\"the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis \\nof what I thought those people cared about. So when somebody is pointed \\nand opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic \\nfairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.\"\\n\\n\\nF.C.C. World abounds in theories about Michael Powell. One is that he \\ncan\\'t make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries \\nhe regulates—so he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the \\nmarket, in order to buy himself time. Another is that he\\'s carrying \\nwater for the arbocks and the big cable companies. Another is that he is \\nplanning to run for the Senate from Virginia (or to be appointed \\nAttorney General in a second Bush term), and doesn\\'t want to do anything \\nat the F.C.C. that would diminish his chances. Another is that he\\'s \\nwaiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, \\nso that he doesn\\'t wind up going first and getting caught in the \\ncrossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television \\nnetworks. (In F.C.C. World, this is known as the Powell Doctrine of \\nTelecom, after Colin Powell\\'s idea that the United States should never \\ncommit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, \\nand an exit strategy.) And another is that he actually believes what he \\nsays, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and \\nirreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.\\n\\n\"This is why elections matter,\" Reed Hundt, who isn\\'t happy about what \\nhas become of his Telecom Act, told me. It\\'s true that the F.C.C.—much \\nmore than, say, the war in Afghanistan—is a case in which a Gore \\nAdministration would be acting quite differently from the Bush \\nAdministration. Consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but \\nthere\\'s no question whether communications companies have noticed. The \\narbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would \\nhave done if Gore had won. Next election, they\\'ll help the party that \\nhelped them. If the Republicans win, policy will tilt further in the \\narbocks\\' favor. If they lose, perhaps the arbocks\\' rivals—the \\nlong-distance companies and the telecommunications upstarts—with their \\nfriends now in power, will stage a comeback. America\\'s present is not \\nunrecognizably different from America\\'s past.\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

A recent study (1) found a 97 percent agreement between the MSU data and temperatures measured by thermometers suspended beneath weather balloons released by meteorologists for weather observations.\\n\\nOnce the monthly temperature data is collected from the satellites and processed, it is placed in a \"public\" computer file for immediate access by atmospheric scientists in the U.S. and abroad. It has become the basis for a number of major studies in global climate change, and is cited in reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\\n\\n\\n\\nGATHERING THE DATA\\n\\nWhile traditional thermometers measure the temperature at a specific point in the air, a microwave sounding unit on a satellite takes readings that are average temperatures in a huge volume of the atmosphere. Each of the more than 30,000 readings per day per satellite is an average temperature for more than 75,000 cubic kilometers of air.\\n\\nThe MSU makes a direct measurement of the temperature by looking at microwaves emitted by oxygen molecules in the atmosphere. The intensity of the microwave emissions - their \"brightness\" - varies according to temperature.\\n\\nChristy and Spencer developed a method to take the data from several satellites and produce a unified temperature dataset.\\n\\n\\n\\nVERIFYING THE ACCURACY OF MSU MEASUREMENTS\\n\\nA recent comparison (1) of temperature readings from two major climate monitoring systems - microwave sounding units on satellites and thermometers suspended below helium balloons - found a \"remarkable\" level of agreement between the two.\\n\\nTo verify the accuracy of temperature data collected by microwave sounding units, Christy compared temperature readings recorded by \"radiosonde\" thermometers to temperatures reported by the satellites as they orbited over the balloon launch sites.\\n\\nHe found a 97 percent correlation over the 16-year period of the study. The overall composite temperature trends at those sites agreed to within 0.03 degrees Celsius (about 0.054° Fahrenheit) per decade. The same results were found when considering only stations in the polar or arctic regions.\\n\\n\"The idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,\" Christy said. \"If satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else.\"\\n\\nThe 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees Celsius (about 0.28° Fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. Over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend: 0.128 degrees Celsius (about 0.23° Fahrenheit) per decade.\\n\\nGlobally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees Celsius per decade since the first NOAA TIROS-N satellites went into service.\\n\\n\"These 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,\" Christy said. \"They are not representative of the total globe.\"\\n\\nRadiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time. As each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio.\\n\\nWhile there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. Christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been long-term systematic and reliable data collection. These 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by Iceland, Trinidad, Truk Island and Alaska.\\n\\nIn an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by NOAA from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17-year climate trend of -0.05° C per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, Christy said.\\n\\n\\n\\nGLOBAL COVERAGE\\n\\nOne advantage of the MSU dataset is its global coverage. Microwave sounding units aboard NOAA satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. Each satellite measures the temperature above most points on Earth every 12 hours.\\n\\nThe \\'global temperature\\' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. It neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including Antarctica, the Brazilian rain forests, the Sahara Desert and Greenland.\\n\\nThe most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from ground-based thermometers. More than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists.\\n\\nMost of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. In the U.S. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports.\\n\\nThe ground-based network is extensive in North America, Europe, Russia, China and Japan. It is less comprehensive in Africa, South America, Australia and across much of Southern Asia.\\n\\nTemperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. \"Radiosonde\" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight Greenwich standard time.\\n\\nWhile balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. There are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. If they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the Earth\\'s surface.\\n\\nWater temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard \"ships of opportunity.\" The ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. The water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavily-travelled shipping lanes, and in harbors.\\n\\nIn the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data.\\n\\n\\n\\nINSTRUMENT ACCURACY; MSU\\n\\nWith nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series.\\n\\nEach satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. The biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. Periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases.\\n\\nBecause the MSU instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. The final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2)\\n\\nTo check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16-year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate.\\n\\n\\n\\nINSTRUMENT ACCURACY; GROUND-BASED THERMOMETERS\\n\\nOf great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. Since most thermometers for which long-term records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. This temperature change may be an artifact of a local \"asphalt effect\" rather than a long-term widespread climate change.\\n\\n\\n\\nINSTRUMENT ACCURACY; SHIPS OF OPPORTUNITY\\n\\nWhile the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface - the level from which water is drawn into the ships.\\n\\nThe thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places.\\n\\nOnly in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE SCIENTISTS\\n\\nIn 1996, Spencer and Christy received the American Meteorological Society\\'s Special Award. They were honored \"for developing a global, precise record of the Earth\\'s temperature from operational polar-orbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate.\"\\n\\nAMS Special Awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specifically-defined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society.\\n\\nIn 1991, Spencer and Christy received NASA\\'s Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal.\\n\\n\\n\\nDR. JOHN CHRISTY\\n\\nChristy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at UAH in 1987, after earning his B.A. (1973) in mathematics from California State University-Fresno, his M.Div. (1978) from Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary, and his M.S. (1984) and Ph.D. (1987) degrees in atmospheric sciences from the University of Illinois.\\n\\nHe was an instructor of mathematics at Parkland College in Champaign, IL, 1983-87, an instructor of mathematics at the University of South Dakota, 1981-82, and an instructor of mathematical sciences at Yankton (S.D.) College, 1980-81.\\n\\nHe also served as pastor of the Grace Baptist Church in Vermillion, S.D., 1978-82, and as science master at Baptist High School, Nyeri, Kenya, 1973-75. He has published more than 20 refereed scientific papers.\\n\\nChristy serves on the NOAA National Scientific Review Panel for the National Climatic Data Center, and on NOAA\\'s Pathfinder Review Panel. He was an \"invited key contributor\" to the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\\'s scientific assessment of climate change, and served as a contributor to the 1992 and 1994 IPCC reports.\\n\\n\\n\\nDR. ROY SPENCER\\n\\nSpencer began his career as a research associate at the Space Science and Engineering Center in Madison, WI, in 1981, after earning his B.S. (1978) in meteorology at the University of Michigan and his M.S. (1979) and Ph.D. (1981) degrees in meteorology from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He was a Universities Space Research Association visiting scientist at MSFC, 1984-87, before joining the MSFC staff in 1987.\\n\\nHe is the U.S. team leader for the Multichannel Microwave Imaging Radiometer Team and has served on numerous committees relating to remote sensing. He directs a program involving satellite and aircraft passive microwave data to build global climate data sets and to address climate research issues.

I believe a suitable memorial\\nsurrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,\\nchildren\\'s playgrounds, possibly some concessions such\\nas a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works\\nwould be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.\\nWhat do you think should done with the space?\\n\\nJoe Adams\\nHillsdale, New Jersey\\n\\nI dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan\\nthat\\'s designed by committee and that\\'s gone through\\npublic hearings and so forth ----- it\\'s going to be cold\\nand ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more\\npublic space that the public hates, of which there are\\nplenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city\\nand that\\'s the beauty of it, it\\'s a city of young\\nambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the\\ntowers, and it\\'s not a memorializing city. Historic\\nevents occurred in New York that in any other city would\\nbe commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and\\nhistorical museums and in New York there\\'s barely a\\nlittle plaque. That\\'s a great thing, in my estimation.\\nIt\\'s a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for\\ntheir big chance, and compared to that spirit of\\nentrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a\\nstatue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant\\'s\\nTomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President\\nGrant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant\\'s Tomb\\nand think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all\\nthe things that New York is about. If you want to find\\nGrant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New\\nYork: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial\\ncity. New York is for the young and lively.\\n\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Please see the bottom of this\\nmessage for further information and removal instructions.\\n\\n\\nPARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN IN\\nHIS CLOSET!\\n\\nDoes this headline look familiar? Of course it does. You most likely have\\njust seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program (USA).\\nAnd reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck of the woods -\\nNew Zealand). His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when\\nshe came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried\\nbeneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old\\nsons closet. Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when\\nshe opened the bag and found it was full of cash. Five-dollar bills, twenties,\\nfifties and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles.\\n\\n\"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank\", says the 41-year-old\\nwoman, \"There was over $71,000 dollars in that bag --that\\'s more than my\\nhusband earns in a year\".\\n\\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where\\nhe worked to tell him what she had discovered.He came home right away\\nand they drove together to the boys school and picked him up.  Little did\\nthey suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than\\nactually finding it in the closet.\\n\\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via E-mail, a type of \\n\"Report\" to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the Internet. Everyday\\nafter school for the past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his\\ncomputer in his bedroom.\\n\\n\"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the heck, I put my name\\non it like the instructions said and I started sending it out\", says the clever\\n15-year-old.\\n\\nThe E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained instructions to send one\\n$5 dollar bill to each person on the list, then delete the address at the top\\nand move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to\\nthe top of the list.\\n\\nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand\\ndollars in five-dollar bills within 2 weeks if you sent out the letter with your\\nname at the top of the 5-address list. \"I get junk E-mail all the time, and\\nreally did not think it was going to work\", the boy continues.\\n\\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, the Post Office Box\\nthat his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions\\nbegan to fill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing $5 bills.\\n\\n\"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post office and my box\\nhad 1 magazine and about 300 envelops stuffed in it. There was also a\\nyellow slip that said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. I thought I\\nwas in trouble or something (laughs)\". He goes on, \"I went up to the\\ncounter and they had a whole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back\\nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all\".  Over\\nthe next few weeks, the boy continued sending out the E-mail.\"  The\\nmoney just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the\\ncloset, barely had time for my homework\".He had also been riding his bike\\nto several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, \\nfifties and hundreds.\\n\\n\"I didn\\'t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks\\nwith like five thousand at a time in my backpack. I would usually tell the\\nlady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the\\nmoney] and he was outside waiting for me.One time the lady gave me a\\nreally strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me\\nand my dad would have to come in and do it, but I just rode to the next\\nbank down the street (laughs).\"  Surprisingly, the boy did not have any\\nreason to be afraid.The reporting news \\n\\nteam examined and investigated the so-called \"chain-letter\" the boy was\\nsending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all.In fact, it was\\ncompletely legal according to US Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18,\\nSection 1302 and 1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also in\\nthe code of federal regulations, Volume 16, Sections 255 and 436, which\\nstate a product or service must be exchanged for money received.\\n\\nEvery five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read,\\n\"Please send me report number XYX\".This simple note made the letter\\nlegal because he was exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a \\nfive-dollar fee.\\n\\n[This is the end of the media release. If you would like to understand how\\nthe system works and get your $71,000 - please continue reading. What \\nappears below is what the 15 year old was sending out on the net -\\n YOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions].\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nBE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!! Before you\\nsay \"Bull\", please read the following. This is the letter you have been\\nhearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of this letter on the\\n Internet, a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire\\nshow to the investigation of this program described below, to see if it really\\ncan make people money. The show also investigated whether or not the\\nprogram was legal. Their findings proved once and for all that there are\\n\"absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if\\npeople can follow the simple instructions, they are bound to make some\\nmegabucks with only $25 out of pocket cost\".\\n\\n\\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS\\nPROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER\\nTHAN EVER.\\n\\n\\nNote* follow the directons below, I had best results the second time when\\nI hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions.\\n\\nIn order for all of us to be successful, many, many emails must be sent so\\nthat the returns are many. I have been extremely successful using the\\nfollowing company. They send out the offers, and all I do is accept money\\nfor reports, then I send back to the people as soon as possible.\\n\\nThis is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I was \\napproached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so glad I\\nfinally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal\\neffort and money required. To my astonishment, I received total\\n$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in\".\\n\\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nHere is another testimonial: \"This program has been around for a long time \\nbut I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again in the\\nmail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple instructions\\nand walaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to come in. First month I\\nonly made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made a total of\\n$290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the program, I\\nhave made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to\\nsuccess in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change\\nanything.\" More testimonials later but first,\\n\\nPRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE\\n\\n++++ Order all 5 reports shown on the list below +++\\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE \\nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the\\nperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE\\nSURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT\\n CORNER in case of any mail problems.\\n\\n When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 reports.\\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer.\\nWithin a few days you will receive, vie e-mail, each of the 5 reports from\\nthese 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will be\\naccessible for you to send to the 1,000\\'s of people who will order them from\\nyou. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case\\nsomething happens to your computer.\\n\\n\\nIMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next\\nto each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other than what is\\ninstructed below in step \"1 through 6\" or you will loose out on majority of\\nyour profits. Once you understand the way this works, you will also see\\nhow it does not work if you change it. Remember, this method has been\\ntested, and if you alter, it will NOT work!!! People have tried to put their\\nfriends/relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the money.\\nBut it does not work this way. Believe us, we all have tried to be greedy\\nand then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change anything other than\\nwhat is instructed. Because if you do, it will not work for you. Remember,\\nhonesty reaps the reward!!!\\n\\n\\n1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement and\\nREMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # 5. This person\\nhas made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune.\\n2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT #5.\\n3....

DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. Save this on a\\ndisk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist you with marketing\\nyour business on the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will provide you\\nwith invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk\\ne-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads and much\\nmore. There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:\\n\\n\\nMETHOD #1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we will\\nassume You and those involved send out only 5,000e-mails each. Let\\'s\\nalso assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response\\ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people\\nwill send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).\\nContinuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails.\\n\\n\\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10\\npeople responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000.\\nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That equals\\n100 people responded and ordered Report # 2.\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 e-mails.\\nThe 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report #3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million\\ne-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report #4.\\n\\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000\\norders for Report #5. THAT\\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES\\n$5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million). Your total income in this example is:\\n1..... $50 +2.....$500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000.......\\nGrand Total=$555,550.00\\n\\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT\\nTHE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU\\nCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment\\nwhat would happen if everyone or half or even one 4th of those people\\nmailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over 150 million people on \\nthe Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many people will do just\\nthat, and more!\\n\\n\\nMETHOD #2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of\\nFREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet will\\neasily get a larger response.\\n\\n\\nWe strongly suggest you start with Method #1 and add METHOD #2 as\\nyou go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must do is e-mail them the\\nReport they ordered. That\\'s it. Always provide same day service on all\\norders. This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name\\nand address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they\\nreceive the report.\\n\\n=ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always\\nsend $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT\\naccepted. Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2\\nsheets of paper or aluminum foil. On one of those sheets of paper, Write\\nthe NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL \\nADDRESS and your name and postal address.\\n\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW:\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nREPORT #1: The Insider\\'s Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net\\n\\nOrder Report #1 from:\\nR.

If you did not, continue advertising or sending e-mails until\\nyou do.\\n\\n+++ Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report #2, YOU CAN\\nRELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will\\ncontinue to roll in! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different\\nreport. You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which\\nreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE\\nMORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START\\nTHE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT to the income you\\ncan generate from this business!!!\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS\\nPROGRAM: You have just received information that can give you\\nfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A\\nLITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can make more money in the next few\\nweeks and months than you have ever imagined. Follow the program\\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way. It works\\nexceedingly well as it is now.\\n\\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your\\nname and address in Report#1 and moved others to #2 thru #5 as\\ninstructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out\\n100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them.\\nRemember though, the more you send out the more potential customers\\nyou will reach.

My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an\\naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.\\nWhen I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \\n\"junk mail\". I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the\\npopulation and percentages involved. I \"knew\" it wouldn\\'t work. Jody\\ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in\\nwith both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old \\n\"I told you so\" on her when the thing didn\\'t work. Well, the laugh was on\\nme! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45\\ndays she had received total $ 147,200.00....all cash! I was shocked.\\nI have joined Jody in her \"hobby\".\\n\\nMitchell Wolf, Chicago, Illinois\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my\\nmind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided that\\nthe initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I\\nwouldn\\'t get enough orders to at least get my money back\". \"I was\\nsurprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with\\norders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about\\nthis deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn\\'t a\\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big\".\\n\\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\\n\\n+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++\\n\"I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered if I\\nshould have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact to get\\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone\\nelse......11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not delete\\nthis one!

Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.\\n        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.\\n        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.\\n        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.\\n        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.\\n        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.\\n        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke. Tako se u nastupima na opstinskim odborima, mogu cuti uverljivi govori Dejana Stjepanovica i Igora Raicevica, i po neki Milinka Isakovica iz redova mladih socijalista, clanova organizaciono politickog odbora predsednika SPS. \\n        Obracanja ovih mladih ljudi, medju clanstvom partije imaju do deset puta vecu tezuni, nego li obracanja profesionalnih politicara koji za sobom vuku teret proslosti.\\n         Stav rukovodstva mladih socijalista, se razlikuje od stava saveta mladih, koji su takodje na strani predsednika. \\n         Branko Ruzic i Dejan Backovic, svojevremeno najveci branioci i zastupnici lika i dela Slobodana Milosevica, danas su se pretvorili u njegove najvece kriticare. Pokusavaju na sve moguce nacine da minorizuju grupu mladih koja ga podrzava.\\n         Cak se poslednjih dana cuje, da je najbolji recept da se rukovodstvo mladih odrzi ikao je protiv Sloba, da se povezu rodbinskim vezama, pa se tako predsednik mladih socijalista Beograda, Ana Djurovic udala za Branka Ruzica, predsednika Mladih socijalista Srbije, koji je za kuma uzeo Dejna Backovia, svog potpredsednika. Backovic se ovih dana zeni, jednom  mladom socijalistkinjom koja je clan saveta mladih, a u isto vreme i sestra jednog od clanova IO GO SPS-a, za kuma uzima jos jednog mladog socijalistu iz Saveta mladih. Sve u svemu, mladi u SPS se drze kao italijanske mafijaske porodice 60-tih u SAD.\\n          Sta ce se do kraja price dogoditi ostaje pitanje, no clanstvo i simpatizeri ce oceniti rad svog rukovodstva na predsednickim izborima.\\n          Pimato se samo, sta ce da rade, ako im Bata prodje losije od Seselja koga je predsednik Slobodan Milosevic podrzao za predsednickog kandidat?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n_______________________________________________________________________\\nPowered by List Builder\\nTo unsubscribe follow the link:\\nhttp://lb.bcentral.com/ex/sp?c=15279&s=90B245569C3B981A&m=4\\n\"),\n",

              "  'It was the Spring of 1979.  \\n\\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\\n\\nStealing other kids\\' lunch money.\\n\\nNo, I didn\\'t rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\\nthem a little deal.  \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said,\\n\"and I\\'ll bring you five dollars next week.\"  The investment\\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \\nwhen \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn\\'t pony up the cash,\\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \\nlonger.\\n\\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \\nthings on their mind than last year\\'s lunch money.\\n\\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\\nand I didn\\'t even get beat up.\\n\\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \\nsecrets you will ever learn.\\n\\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You\\'re not\\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\\nyou\\'re ahead.  Don\\'t wait for the boat to sink before \\ngrabbing the lifejacket.\\n\\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\\n\\nThe \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and\\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\\nyour money in the market, the more money you\\'re going to make.\\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\\n\"NEVER\".  \\n\\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\\nfund right now, you\\'ll probably have over a million dollars\\nin thirty or forty years.  But here\\'s the problem:\\n\\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\\n\\nHell no!\\n\\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It\\'s hard to\\nmake use of your fortune when you\\'re seventy years old \\nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \\n\\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\\n\\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don\\'t\\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\\nit was UNSTABLE.  That\\'s how you\\'re going to make the \\nmoney.\\n\\nWhat I\\'m talking about here is day trading.  \\n\\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \\nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \\nhe makes money. \\n\\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \\nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \\ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \\ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \\n\\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \\namounts of money at it.  It\\'s not rocket science, and you \\nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\\n\\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \\ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \\n\\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \\nstrategies to make money.  \\n\\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\\nring.  They don\\'t want the competetion - and they sure as hell\\ndon\\'t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\\nto execute a trade for which they\\'d charge you forty or fifty \\ndollars.\\n\\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\\n\\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \\nperson.\\n\\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \\ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \\nper trade.\\n\\nHere is what the financial gurus in today\\'s society absolutely,\\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\\n\\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\\na few hours of studying.  \\n\\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\\nthe stock market, I\\'ve learned the following lessons:\\n\\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\\n\\n** Anyone can do it.\\n\\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\\n\\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn\\'t become\\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \\nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \\nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\\n\\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \\npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \\nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \\nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from\\nmy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,\\nsecret formula for day trading that I\\'ve used profitably\\nyear after year.\\n\\nThe income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even \\nhundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within\\nminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your \\nshirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,\\nand I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. \\n\\nAverage Income of a Day Trader: \\n5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year\\n22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year\\n35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. \\n27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year \\n11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year \\n\\nAfter reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely \\nprofitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give \\nyou an almost unfair trading advantage and make you \\nwin DESPITE the current market weakness. \\n\\nHere is just a snippet of what I will teach you:\\n\\n*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to \\nbuy them and the exact price to sell them. \\n\\n\\n*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the \\nmistakes beginners make.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money \\nconsistently in every market! \\n\\n\\n*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance \\nfor great success. \\n\\n\\n*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.\\n\\n\\n*** Make money on the biggest news stories.\\n\\n\\n*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum\\nreturns. \\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street \\nprofessionals use.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s time to ask yourself: \"Am I going to listen to the \\nProfessionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am\\nI going to take control of my own financial future, and\\nstart making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?\"\\n\\nWho is looking out for your best economic interests - some\\nwealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?\\n\\nWith the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you \\nneed to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from \\nchoosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the \\nlowest commissions and instant order executions to professional \\ntrading strategies that make professional traders millions of \\ndollars.\\n\\nThe Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to \\nunderstand and straight-forward book ever written about active \\ntrading. If you are serious about success in short term stock \\ntrading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your\\nown financial future.\\n\\nOh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?\\nHis high school friends laughed when he said he was going to \\nmake money in the stock market.  \\n\\nSix years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California\\ncoast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren\\'t laughing anymore.\\n\\nIn a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading\\nis the fastest track to wealth.  If you\\'re looking\\nfor a long-term retirement investment with no risk \\nthat goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain\\'t\\nyour kind of game.\\n\\nBut if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE\\nin the market, with the lowest element of risk, then\\norder the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise\\nto teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a\\nmillionaire through successful day trading.\\n\\nYou don\\'t need to know anything about the market, and\\nanyone can do it, with minimum effort.

              "  'Foreword\\n\\nAfter thirty?three years of being a black man living in \"Ghetto America,\" an environment notorious for danger, crime, and poverty, I have made startling discoveries involving young African?American men and women who comprise what I have come to define as the \"Black Generation X\". I have become aware that there is no formal distinction separating young African?Americans from the general definition of \"Generation X\". Aside from it being regarded as the generation that followed \"Baby Boomers\", it\\'s important to point out there is no root definition for this term as well. Since the theme of this work is centered on identifying the realities and misconceptions of young African?American culture, I have chosen a definition that incorporates all of the components that were part of my birth, childhood, and young adult life. Taken from a web site entitled \"Generation X\", created and maintained by the Colorado College, the definition is as follows: \\n \\n \"We are a group of people born between 1961 and 1981. We are individuals who live for the \\'here and now\\', like to experiment, and who require immediate results. We are typically selfish, and cynical, and depend a lot on our parents. We question authority, and feel like we carry the burden of the previous generations. It\\'s that simple. It seems we have come to be called \"Xer\\'s\" simply because we represent something negative to our elders. We may be the one thing all of the generations that precede us have in common, that is the ability to speak assuredly about our shortcomings. Of course, they overlook the fact that we are their responsibility, or actually their fault. Our generation will be called upon to look after our parents knowing they failed to look after us. Intergenerational justice failed somewhere along the way and it will be our task to either rectify it or make it worse.\"\\n\"We are a group of individuals who grew up with no one at home after school. It appears we have little hope for the future. No jobs, no homes, and basically no money are almost expected of us. These bleak prospects, along with the fact that we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever, do not provide much hope. Some believe that these blockades will be too much for us to handle and we will for the most part fail at life, but many see our individualism and resourcefulness that has been built up through our childhood, as our saviors. We will soon discover who is right and who is wrong.\" \\n\\nThis definition is important because it demonstrates the widely held belief that Generation X is comprised of one core group of American citizens. It over generalizes the similarities it expresses, and applies them to all those who were born within the corresponding years. When in fact these \"similarities\" speak primarily to only \"white\" issues and concerns. For instance, \"they\" say \"we\" depend a lot on our parents, but in ghetto America \"we\" could only depend on one �our mothers! \"They\" also say, \" . . .we feel like we carry the burden of previous generations,\" and \" . . . we will be forced to support the largest amount of senior citizens ever.\" In ghetto America, no one ever gives these issues any thought because survival is in the here and now, and is all \"we\" have time for. \\nI have known for many years that the differences that separate Generation Xer\\'s black and white occupants would eventually be identified. I never knew I would be the one doing it. Extracting the \"Black\" from \"Generation X\" and categorizing it for its own sake is a necessary and important contingency. Without doing so, the social ills that plague Ghetto America would be lost within the generalities that are explained away as part of a collective American identity.\\nThere are many hidden truths that exist in black America today. \"White America\" charges that we spend our time collecting welfare, refusing to vote, reading elementary styled books, watching music videos, day dreaming of becoming rappers, basketball players, selling drugs, and making babies. Much of this is supported in Marlon Riggs\\'s documentary entitled \"Ethnic Notions.\" When African Americans are mentioned, whites typically envision an image that is strikingly similar to the one that graces the cover of this book. A reality that I confirmed while watching \"Roger & Me,\" another documentary written, and directed by Michael Moore. Sadly, many of us have begun to validate this skewed image, while others bend over backwards in an attempt to pretend we do nothing of the kind, only to be contradicted and embarrassed when presented with the daily programming line up for B.E.T. (Black Entertainment Television). Many of us fail to realize, that whatever embarrassment or shame the ex\\n posed truth may reveal, should be taken as an opportunity to improve, empower, enlighten, and ultimately change anyone who is guilty of perpetrating this kind of behavior.\\nRegarding Black Women: I have known many in my life and although each has had unique attitudes and personalities, I began to notice the majority of them shared the same collective mentality toward black men as a whole-that black men owed them something, and are required to provide and fulfill what was missing from their lives, be it emotional, physical, or economical.\\n Normally that type of assertion would not warrant opposition from me, so long as a reciprocal attitude was extended. In most cases, it has not been. It\\'s funny though, looking back, I am surprised I never paid any attention to the beliefs and attitudes that different black women subscribe to, or the various schools of thought they possessed. Many have placed strict demands and presumptions on the African?American male, some fair and some unfair. Much of what the public believes and understands about the black female\\'s social structure is often filtered by others in the black community who believe these inaccurate and frequently positive representations will somehow change the reality that is. \\nWhat originally sparked my attention was an observation I stumbled upon while skimming through and reading books related to black male and female interaction. I noticed virtually all of the books I read in the genre depict an inaccurate and misleading concentration on the affluent African?American perspective. These stories and commentaries tend to suggest that all African?Americans thrive on a middle?to?upper class professional level. They relay stories of relationship problems with \"Huxtable?like\" bachelors and bachelorettes whose only concern is why the other has not confessed his or her love. As I read these stories I couldn\\'t help but become irritated by the blatant omission of the prevailing majority of blue collar or \"working class\" African?Americans. Although there are those in the black community that can identify with the \"Huxtable?like\" dynamic, unfortunately, they are few and far between. \\nThe majority of stories I have read seem to be geared toward fantasizing and romanticizing the oppressive state of affairs that have plagued Black America. The black authors who have written these books fear the potential backlash awaiting anyone who would dare air out our \"dirty laundry\". The fact is, truth should never be stifled by fear of any kind. \\nI recently had a candid conversation with some very dear female friends who stated that although they fully acknowledge the terrible state of affairs many of our women are currently drowning in, they felt that publicizing their predicament would be viewed as a form of betrayal. As our discussion intensified, I reminded them that the only way change can be effected is by increasing public awareness that change is needed, and oftentimes, not exposing the truth can be more crippling than the truth itself. \\nThe purpose of my book is in essence an attempt to change the self?destructive thinking and self?imprisoning behavior that \"black male and female generation X\" have been subscribing to. While discussing this with my friend, she suggested I simplify my writing style so my potential black readers could better understand what I\\'m attempting to convey. Acknowledging the real possibility of my message being misunderstood, I suggest to those readers that if they want to fully appreciate the finer points of this narrative-to grab a dictionary. (Don\\'t feel bad-there were several times I had to as well!)\\nRegarding Black Men: An overwhelming number of us have become preoccupied with being cool, buying sports wear, driving expensive cars, wearing gold or platinum jewelry, and often without legitimate personal wealth and while living under the most deplorable conditions! I have chosen to address this rarely acknowledged side of African?American culture because I have lived it. I have seen the chaos and futility that exists on this level. It is a world of ignorance, selfishness, pre?occupation, and idiocy.\\nIn my world there are people who applaud a lack of education, who brag about having served time in U.S. penitentiaries, the types of guns they carry, dope peddling, and chasing women. They champion the notion of having children without any regard to the poor environment many of them currently inhabit. In this world, wearing expensive clothes and carrying fancy handbags is mandatory even if it means spending their last dollar in order to look like they\\'ve got a million. It\\'s a world where children dress in over?priced sports wear, mimicking and idolizing whatever popular athlete or rapper is currently in the public eye. \\nThinking, such as the belief that fancy clothes are what define one\\'s self?worth, and the possible corruption this thinking breeds, seems to not be an important concern for black mothers. It may come as a shock to know that most African?Americans feel that those who don\\'t have the same, if not better, material possessions, are lesser beings, referring to them as being corny, lame, or broke. Even our \"male rapper\" entertainers promote backward priorities-nothing else matters as long as you look good. \"The Big Tymers\", a popular rap duo, have a song called \"I\\'m Still Fly\", shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. and played regularly on black radio stations throughout the country. (\"Fly\" is ghetto vernacular for well dressed, also used to describe a female\\'s beauty). Its signature verse asserts:\\n\\n\"I got gator boots with a pimped out Gucci\\nSuit, can\\'t pay my rent cause all my money\\'s\\nspent, but that\\'s O.K. cause I\\'m still fly.\"\\n\\nWorse yet, in the song \"Grinding\", the popular duo \"Eclipse\" glorifies the selling of illegal drugs in inner city neighborhoods as children play and dance throughout the entire video. (The term \"grinding\" is ghetto vernacular for the selling of illegal drugs) The fact that this song and video is also shown in heavy rotation on B.E.T. is further evidence that our world is in utter turmoil. Some of the key lyrics to this song are \"grinding�you know what I keep in the lining\" (the area in their coats where they hide illegal drugs) and\\n\\n\"Patty cake Patty cake I\\'m the bakers man\\nI bake them cakes as fast as I can\\nand you can tell cause of how my bread stack up\\nand I disguise it as rap so the feds backup\"\\n\\nIn this verse, the group refers to the process of cooking cocaine and its transformation into cocaine base or crack. When created it is compressed into the form of a large cookie with the average diameter being the size of a typical cake. (hence the term \"cake\" or sometimes \"pie\") Unfortunately for the rap genre, this song seems to strengthen the long standing argument posed by most whites that rap music is nothing more than an entertainment medium catering to violent drug offenders, who want and do nothing more than carry guns and break the law. \\nThe negative references I\\'ve identified have become an integral part of the urban African?American existence. This mutated reality is ridiculous and unacceptable. This ideology should not be permitted to continue any longer than it already has. There is an overwhelming part of the African?American community that is aware of this crippling mentality. There are also many that are unaware and unfortunately, more that do not even care. Those of us who are in the know have a responsibility to educate and enlighten those of us who are not aware of the negative behavior being perpetrated daily. Whether because of habit or misguided values, this type of ideology is cyclical and thrives off of ignorance. It should be apparent to us all that we cannot wait for some other race to come and save us. We must save ourselves! I am well aware that many of you are probably furious by now, and are thinking, what right do I have to express the opinions I have thus far, as well as those I have al\\n luded too. \\nI have chosen to chronicle my experiences because of the diversity and seriousness of their content. There is far too much negativity thriving within our culture. There must be acknowledgment and accountability for the truth, whether good or bad. I am aware that not all of \"us\" have succumbed to the crippling mentality that is rampant in our community, and I have chosen to concentrate on individuals who have had a profound impact on my life. Any similarities and generalizations I illustrate are directed solely toward individuals in the black community who share the collective negative thinking and behavior that will hereafter be identified. \\nAdditionally, throughout this book I will refer to African?Americans in four different ways; the first being \"African?Americans\", denoting our status as citizens in the United States; secondly, as \"Black\", a reference that identifies and defines our differences and struggles in this country; third, as \"Niggas,\" a term which is often misunderstood and should not be confused with \"Nigger\". The term \"nigga\" has become an accepted form of reference among young black males used to express friendship (hence the term \"My Nigga\") as well as a blanket reference when speaking to, of, or about other black males in a non?personal manner. I felt it necessary to make this distinction because many of the experiences I will refer to mandate the use of the term to effectively communicate the attitude and mood that existed during the time each story took place; and fourth, as \"Ghetto\", this term is largely intended as an internal reference commonly understood by blacks as a means to define the\\n  less polished members of our community.  It is important to note that the use of either term has no negative connotation and is therefore not to be associated with any feeling as such. \\nMy commentary is based on real?life situations, both good and bad, and how one African?American man was affected by them. To that end, I feel it is necessary to acknowledge that my intention is not to condemn the individuals I have encountered. Despite the negativity they have displayed, I only want to make them aware that the selfish and self debasing attitudes they subscribed to, in many ways, has caused them to become their own worst enemy.\\nIn the case of the black female\\'s negative and limited perspective toward black men, the world, and subconsciously themselves, I submit that this mentality is perhaps single?handedly responsible for the lack of success, happiness, and quality of life that is at the center of every African?American woman\\'s fantasy quest. It is also important to note that the selfish and negative attitudes at the core of the tension that exists between black women and men, has been deliberately created by \"White America\". For example, much of the existing resentment between black women and men can be traced as far back as slavery on up to present day. Many past issues have taken on new identities and have re?emerged in the form of corporate acceptance of black women and the corporate exclusion of black men. The resulting economic independence that some black women now enjoy has caused them to challenge and judge the black man for his absence within corporate America, without realizing and ackno\\n wledging that this absence is by design. \\nThere are other \"core\" issues that have been passed down and nurtured from generation to generation, such as color barriers, light skin versus dark skin, good hair versus bad hair, loyalty, devotion, and economic status. Believe it or not, there was once a time when black women refused to date a black man if he didn\\'t sell drugs or was not \"thugged out\". (a term for being rough or hoodlum-like) The reasoning behind it being that the \"thug,\" and \"drug dealer\" lifestyle was synonymous with financial independence. \\nThese issues, among others, relate directly to the confused mentality that exists within our internal society. Sadly that \"confused mentality\" is responsible for much of the neglect the African American \"ghetto\" community receives at the hands of our more affluent brethren. Who have locked it away in the basement, and seems to be more concerned with convincing the rest of the world that \"ghetto America does not exist. Furthermore, the lack of acknowledgement of which I speak should not be confused with the impoverished masses of the African American community.  Their plight is a well-known reality, but in many cases much of ghetto America falls under that same umbrella. Be advised: this book is not a colorful or lighthearted look into \"Black America\".  Rather it should be viewed as a legitimate tool for identifying and changing the backward thinking that so many young African Americans (including myself) have come to perpetuate. Moreover, that \"backward thinking\" is the main \\n cause of our inability to strive for a common goal. An outcome that must be met; and can only be met, with Godly faith, positive strategy, cooperation, love, loyalty, self and mutual respect.\\n*************************************************************\\n To read More go to www.blackrealitypublishing.com\\n\\n\\nTo Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org\\nwith \"unsubscribe freebsd-ports\" in the body of the message\\n\\n'),\n",

              "  '================This Is Definitely the Answer We All Have Been Waiting For===============\\n\\nEvery once in awhile, something comes along that you just know, from the people involved, from the features, or just from gut-feeling, that it\\'s going to be very special, something with huge potential and hope. When you know it, it rests deep in your bones, and it\\'s hard not to get overly excited and scream it to the world, which is why I\\'m writing you today. Although this program is launching with all the potential of being as big as anything on the Internet, and you will soon see it advertised and promoted everywhere you go, I would like to give you an opportunity to get in early before the masses. Traditionally, there have been a couple of flaws to any MLM (multi-level marketing for you newcomers) that have made it difficult for programs to last after the initial hoopla. Today, we have launched the solution to those problems, the newest and most innovative system ever to hit Multi-level Marketing. With a new software system and an ingenious payplan, combined with a 100% payout, everyone comes out a winner. \\n\\n\\nThe truth is, you\\'ve got to see it to believe it, so rather than feed you a lot of hype and tell you this is the miracle you\\'ve been looking for, the magic link that will end all your problems, or a lot of other things you don\\'t need to hear, I\\'m just going to make you a very simple offer. Email me with \\'Send Link\\' in the subject line to:  itshappening@mail2world.com  and I will provide the link so you can take a test drive, absolutely risk-free. You can get a birds-eye inside look, revealing the inner-workings of this revolutionary new discovery in online income opportunities. Should you decide you like what you see, you will have the option of activating your position, but that is completely at your option. This isn\\'t a trick, I\\'m just so convinced that this is such a sound program and unique but solid opportunity that I don\\'t want you to miss out on the chance to get an early position. With an explosive launch, positions will be filling up rapidly, and you have before you a chance to explore the program before diving in head first. If you\\'re one of those cautious people (and who isn\\'t these days on the Internet), that likes to \"look before you leap\" then here is your chance. Thank you for your time, and I hope you discover why we\\'re all smiling!!\\n\\n\\nPlease do not treat this message as spam. I am a professional and very successful networker with a data base of 100,000. I was pursueded to purchase this list containing 200,000 names of individuals, which is guaranteed to include only those people who have given their consent to receive information.

              "  'It was the Spring of 1979.  \\n\\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\\n\\nStealing other kids\\' lunch money.\\n\\nNo, I didn\\'t rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\\nthem a little deal.  \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said,\\n\"and I\\'ll bring you five dollars next week.\"  The investment\\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \\nwhen \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn\\'t pony up the cash,\\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \\nlonger.\\n\\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \\nthings on their mind than last year\\'s lunch money.\\n\\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\\nand I didn\\'t even get beat up.\\n\\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \\nsecrets you will ever learn.\\n\\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You\\'re not\\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\\nyou\\'re ahead.  Don\\'t wait for the boat to sink before \\ngrabbing the lifejacket.\\n\\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\\n\\nThe \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and\\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\\nyour money in the market, the more money you\\'re going to make.\\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\\n\"NEVER\".  \\n\\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\\nfund right now, you\\'ll probably have over a million dollars\\nin thirty or forty years.  But here\\'s the problem:\\n\\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\\n\\nHell no!\\n\\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It\\'s hard to\\nmake use of your fortune when you\\'re seventy years old \\nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \\n\\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\\n\\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don\\'t\\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\\nit was UNSTABLE.  That\\'s how you\\'re going to make the \\nmoney.\\n\\nWhat I\\'m talking about here is day trading.  \\n\\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \\nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \\nhe makes money. \\n\\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \\nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \\ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \\ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \\n\\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \\namounts of money at it.  It\\'s not rocket science, and you \\nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\\n\\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \\ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \\n\\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \\nstrategies to make money.  \\n\\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\\nring.  They don\\'t want the competetion - and they sure as hell\\ndon\\'t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\\nto execute a trade for which they\\'d charge you forty or fifty \\ndollars.\\n\\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\\n\\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \\nperson.\\n\\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \\ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \\nper trade.\\n\\nHere is what the financial gurus in today\\'s society absolutely,\\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\\n\\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\\na few hours of studying.  \\n\\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\\nthe stock market, I\\'ve learned the following lessons:\\n\\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\\n\\n** Anyone can do it.\\n\\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\\n\\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn\\'t become\\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \\nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \\nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\\n\\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \\npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \\nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \\nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from\\nmy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,\\nsecret formula for day trading that I\\'ve used profitably\\nyear after year.\\n\\nThe income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even \\nhundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within\\nminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your \\nshirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,\\nand I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. \\n\\nAverage Income of a Day Trader: \\n5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year\\n22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year\\n35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. \\n27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year \\n11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year \\n\\nAfter reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely \\nprofitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give \\nyou an almost unfair trading advantage and make you \\nwin DESPITE the current market weakness. \\n\\nHere is just a snippet of what I will teach you:\\n\\n*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to \\nbuy them and the exact price to sell them. \\n\\n\\n*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the \\nmistakes beginners make.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money \\nconsistently in every market! \\n\\n\\n*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance \\nfor great success. \\n\\n\\n*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.\\n\\n\\n*** Make money on the biggest news stories.\\n\\n\\n*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum\\nreturns. \\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street \\nprofessionals use.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s time to ask yourself: \"Am I going to listen to the \\nProfessionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am\\nI going to take control of my own financial future, and\\nstart making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?\"\\n\\nWho is looking out for your best economic interests - some\\nwealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?\\n\\nWith the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you \\nneed to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from \\nchoosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the \\nlowest commissions and instant order executions to professional \\ntrading strategies that make professional traders millions of \\ndollars.\\n\\nThe Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to \\nunderstand and straight-forward book ever written about active \\ntrading. If you are serious about success in short term stock \\ntrading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your\\nown financial future.\\n\\nOh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?\\nHis high school friends laughed when he said he was going to \\nmake money in the stock market.  \\n\\nSix years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California\\ncoast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren\\'t laughing anymore.\\n\\nIn a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading\\nis the fastest track to wealth.  If you\\'re looking\\nfor a long-term retirement investment with no risk \\nthat goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain\\'t\\nyour kind of game.\\n\\nBut if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE\\nin the market, with the lowest element of risk, then\\norder the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise\\nto teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a\\nmillionaire through successful day trading.\\n\\nYou don\\'t need to know anything about the market, and\\nanyone can do it, with minimum effort.

I AM MR.DESMOND STEVENS, THE FIRST SON OF DR. DENNIS STEVENS, WHO WAS RECENTLY MURDERED IN THE LAND DISPUTE IN ZIMBABWE. I WAS FURNISHED WITH VIABLE INFORMATION FROM THE WORLD TRADE CENTRE HERE IN AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS AND DECIDED TO WRITE YOU. \\nBEFORE THE DEATH OF MY FATHER, HE HAD TAKEN ME TO AMSTERDAM TO DEPOSIT THE SUM OF TEN MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$10,500,000) IN A SECURITY COMPANY, AS IF HE FORESAW THE LOOMING DANGER IN ZIMBABWE. THIS MONEY WAS DEPOSITED IN A BOX AS GEMSTONES TO AVOID MUCH DEMURRAGE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. THIS AMOUNT WAS MEANT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NEW MACHINES AND CHEMICALS FOR THE FARMS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF NEW FARM IN SWAZILAND. THIS LAND PROBLEM CAME WHEN ZIMBABWE PRESIDENT MR. ROBERT MUGABE, INTRODUCED A NEW LAND ACT THAT WHOLLY AFFECTED RICH WHITE FARMERS AND SOME FEW BLACK FARMERS. THIS RESULTED TO THE KILLING AND MOB ACTION BY ZIMBABWE WAR VETERANS AND SOME LUNATICS IN THE SOCIETY. INFACT, A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS LAND REFORM ACT OF WHICH MY FATHER WAS ONE OF THE VICTIMS. IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND THAT MY FAMILY AND I WHO ARE CURRENTLY STAYING IN AMSTERDAM DECIDED TO TRANSFER MY FATHER�S MONEY TO \\n A FOREIGN ACCOUNT. SINCE THE LAW OF THE NETHERLANDS PROHIBIT A REFUGEE (ASYLUM SEEKER) TO OPEN ANY ACCOUNT OR TO BE INVOLVED IN ANY FINANCIAL TRANSACTION. \\nAS THE ELDEST SON OF MY FATHER, I AM SADDLED WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OF SEEKING A GENUINE FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE THIS MONEY COULD BE TRANSFERRED WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF MY GOVERNMENT WHO ARE BENT ON TAKING EVERYTHING WE HAVE GOT. I AM FACED WITH THE DILEMMA OF INVESTING THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE NETHERLANDS FOR THE FEAR OF GOING THROUGH THE SAME EXPERIENCE IN FUTURE SINCE BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR HISTORY. MOREOVER, THE NETHERLANDS FOREIGN EXCHANGE POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH INVESTMENT FROM ASYLUM SEEKERS. AS A BUSINESSMAN, WHOM I HAVE ENTRUSTED MY FUTURE AND MY FAMILY IN HIS HANDS, I MUST LET YOU KNOW THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS RISK FREE. IF YOU ACCEPT TO ASSIST ME AND MY FAMILY, ALL I NEED YOU TO DO FOR ME IS TO MAKE ARRANGEMENT AND COME TO AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS SO THAT YOU CAN OPEN THE NON-RESIDENT ACCOUNT WHICH WILL AID US IN TRANSFERRING THE MONEY INTO ANY ACCOUNT YOU WILL NOMINATE OVERSEAS. THIS MONEY I INTEND TO USE FOR INVESTMENT. I HAVE\\n  OPTIONS TO OFFER YOU, FIRST YOU CAN CHOOSE TO HAVE CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE MONEY FOR NOMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT FOR THE TRANSACTION, OR YOU CAN GO INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH ME FOR A PROPER PROFITABLE INVESTMENT OF THE MONEY IN YOUR COUNTRY. WHICHEVER OPTION YOU CHOOSE, FEEL FREE TO NOTIFY ME. I HAVE MAPPED OUT 5% OF THIS MONEY FOR ALL EXPENSES INCURRED IN PROCESSING THIS TRANSACTION. IF YOU DO NOT PREFER A PARTNERSHIP, I AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU 25% OF THE MONEY WHILE THE REMAINING 70% THAT IS MEANT FOR ME, WILL BE FOR THE INVESTMENT IN YOUR COUNTRY. \\nPLEASE, CONTACT ME WITH THE ABOVE TELEPHONE AND E-MAIL ADDRESS, WHILE I IMPLORE YOU TO MAINTAIN THE ABSOLUTE SECRECY REQUIRED IN THE TRANSACTION. \\nYOURS FAITHFULLY, \\nDESMOND STEVENS. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\\n\\n\\n\"),\n",

              "  'Hi,\\n\\nI\\'m a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  \\nI\\'m ambitious, but extremely lazy, and I make over \\n$250,000 a year.  Are you curious yet?\\n\\nIn a minute I\\'m going to tell you my secret,\\nit\\'s the dirty little secret of the Internet ...\\n\\nYou\\'ve probably heard stories about people making\\nwhopping huge money online, but you thought they \\nwere the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or\\nboy-geniuses.\\n\\nWell, grasshopper, think again ...\\n\\nIt\\'s people like you and me that are making the real\\nmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!\\n\\nEver since the \"dot com bubble\" burst in 1999, small-time\\nentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 \\ncompanies look for bankruptcy lawyers.\\n\\nToday small business owners and ordinary folks \\nlike you and me can use the web to achieve complete \\nfinancial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little \\nwork.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing \\ntechnique ever created - it\\'s called BULK EMAIL.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve ever recieved an email advertisement, then \\nyou know what bulk email is.  I bet you can\\'t click on \\nDELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?\\nYou might not want their product, but remember that \\nthousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a \\npercentage game - every bulker who contacts you \\nmakes a six figure income on the Internet.  I \\nguarantee it.  Now let\\'s go back to Math 101 and \\nreview some numbers ...\\n\\nIf you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few\\ndollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one\\nauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a\\ncouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand\\nover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN\\nSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY\\nat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000\\nemails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.\\nZERO!\\n\\nStop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when\\nhardly anyone sees your ad!\\n\\nImagine that you have a decent product with a \\nprofit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send \\nan email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person \\nin a thousand actually places an order, then you just \\ngenerated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours \\nof work.  \\n\\nIt\\'s that simple ...\\n\\nAll you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A\\nTHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you\\'re FILTHY RICH.\\n\\nThe best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn\\'t \\nmatter if you\\'re a nineteen-year-old college student \\nusing a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old \\nexecutive working from an office building in New \\nYork City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start \\nbulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All \\nit takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, \\nand some basic familiarity with the Internet.\\n\\nI quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the \\n\"Dot Com\" mania, and I\\'ve never looked back.  I \\nstarted with no money, no product to sell, and only \\nthe most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an \\nopportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, \\nI bought my own home - with CASH.  \\n\\nYou don\\'t need any money.  You don\\'t need a product.\\nYou don\\'t need to be a computer nerd and no experience\\nwhatsoever is required.  \\n\\nIf you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that\\nyou\\'d jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.\\nSo what are you waiting for?!\\n\\nI\\'m going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer\\nYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you\\nwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.\\n\\nHere goes ...\\n\\nDo you have basic experience with the web? \\nDo you have a computer and an Internet connection?\\nDo you have a few hours each day of free time?  \\nDo you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards \\ncomplete financial freedom?  \\n\\nIf you answer YES to these questions, you could be\\nmaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your \\nhome.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats \\nthe 9-5 daily grind!\\n\\nAll you need is ambition and commitment.  This\\nis no \"get rich quick scheme\".  You have to work\\nto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do \\nit.\\n\\nYou\\'re probably wondering if it\\'s hard to get started.  \\nDon\\'t worry, it\\'s not! I will show you step-by-step \\nhow to start your first email campaign and how to\\nbuild a booming online business.  You\\'ll be generating \\norders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less than seven days.\\n\\nOkay, so what if you don\\'t have anything to sell?\\n\\nNo problem!!

              "  \"Mr.Vincent Nnaji,\\n Standard Trust Bank Ltd,\\n Lagos,Nigeria.\\n Dear Sir,\\n I am Mr.Vincent Nnaji, Bank Manager of Standard Trust Bank,Lagos,Nigeria. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. \\nOn January 6,1998 a Foreign Oil Consultant Foreign contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr. James Herbert made a numbered time Fixed Deposit for twelve calendar months valued at US$20M ( Twenty Million United States Dollars) in my branch.\\nUpon maturity I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. James Herbert died from an automobile accident. \\nOn further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.James Herbert did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$20M has carefully been moved out of my bank to a security company for safe-keeping. No one will ever come forward to claim it. \\nAccording to Nigerian Law at the expiration of 5 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money I deposited it in a security company in two trunk boxes though the security company does not know the contents of the boxes as I tagged them to be photographic materials for export I am writing you because I as a public servant I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account that is more than $1m.\\n I want to present you as the owner of the boxes in the security company so you can be able to claim them with the help of my attorney. All these are to make sure that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. \\nThis is simple. I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will put you in place as the owner of the boxes.

Milosevica, ,,Sloboda'' da im je cilj da uniste Socijalisticku partiju Srbije.\\n        Iako je zbog istih takvih gledista, svojevremeno najpolularniji socijalista, posle predsednika te stranke, prof. Branislav Ivkovic bio iskljucen iz redova SPS, danas rukovodstvo SPS koristi jos teze i grublje kvalifikacije na racun njihovog predsednika, pritom ne strahujuci da bi bilo ko od njih mogao biti iskljucen iz partije.\\n        Ne retko se poslednjih dana, u rokovodstvu partije cuje da partija nije Slobodan Milosevic, i da on ne predstvalja tu partiju, vec da su partija Rukovodstvo i Glavni odbor te stranke.\\n        Medjutim u clanstvu i medju simpatizerima te stranke, stvari se ne odijaju bas po planovima rukovodstva.\\n        Procene idu dotle da se na septembarskim izborima ocekuje da Bata Zivojinovic osvoji tek 1% glasova.  Clanovi partije, najveci deo njih i danas veruje svom heroju, Slobodanu Milosevicu.\\n        Po clanstvu partije, ovih dana u rukovodstvu partije, oni koji su predsednika te stranke pogresno informisali poslednjih godina, kada su shvatili da im je ,,odzvonilo'' pokusavaju da sacuvaju sebe eliminacijom predsednika Slobodana Milosevica.\\n        Mladi socijalisti, kojih i nema bas mnogo, kako se SPS svojevremeno hvalio, izgleda su na strani predsednika te stranke.

Are you curious yet?\\n\\nIn a minute I\\'m going to tell you my secret,\\nit\\'s the dirty little secret of the Internet ...\\n\\nYou\\'ve probably heard stories about people making\\nwhopping huge money online, but you thought they \\nwere the big corporate execs, famous programmers, or\\nboy-geniuses.\\n\\nWell, grasshopper, think again ...\\n\\nIt\\'s people like you and me that are making the real\\nmoney.  Yep, people like YOU AND ME!\\n\\nEver since the \"dot com bubble\" burst in 1999, small-time\\nentrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 \\ncompanies look for bankruptcy lawyers.\\n\\nToday small business owners and ordinary folks \\nlike you and me can use the web to achieve complete \\nfinancial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and very little \\nwork.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing \\ntechnique ever created - it\\'s called BULK EMAIL.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve ever recieved an email advertisement, then \\nyou know what bulk email is.  I bet you can\\'t click on \\nDELETE fast enough for most of those ads, right?\\nYou might not want their product, but remember that \\nthousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a \\npercentage game - every bulker who contacts you \\nmakes a six figure income on the Internet.  I \\nguarantee it.  Now let\\'s go back to Math 101 and \\nreview some numbers ...\\n\\nIf you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few\\ndollars to over a hundred dollars just to post one\\nauction.  How many people see your ad?  Maybe a\\ncouple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand\\nover a period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN\\nSEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE A DAY\\nat virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000\\nemails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.\\nZERO!\\n\\nStop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when\\nhardly anyone sees your ad!\\n\\nImagine that you have a decent product with a \\nprofit margin of $20.00 on each sale.  If you send \\nan email ad to 500,000 people, and only one person \\nin a thousand actually places an order, then you just \\ngenerated 500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours \\nof work.  \\n\\nIt\\'s that simple ...\\n\\nAll you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A\\nTHOUSAND to buy your stuff and you\\'re FILTHY RICH.\\n\\nThe best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn\\'t \\nmatter if you\\'re a nineteen-year-old college student \\nusing a dorm-room computer or a fifty-year-old \\nexecutive working from an office building in New \\nYork City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start \\nbulk emailing with virtually no startup costs.  All \\nit takes is a  few days of study, plenty of ambition, \\nand some basic familiarity with the Internet.\\n\\nI quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the \\n\"Dot Com\" mania, and I\\'ve never looked back.  I \\nstarted with no money, no product to sell, and only \\nthe most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an \\nopportunity and I seized it.  A few years later, \\nI bought my own home - with CASH.  \\n\\nYou don\\'t need any money.  You don\\'t need a product.\\nYou don\\'t need to be a computer nerd and no experience\\nwhatsoever is required.  \\n\\nIf you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that\\nyou\\'d jump right on it.  It would be a dream come true.\\nSo what are you waiting for?!\\n\\nI\\'m going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer\\nYES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you\\nwill make at least $100,000 using bulk email this year.\\n\\nHere goes ...\\n\\nDo you have basic experience with the web? \\nDo you have a computer and an Internet connection?\\nDo you have a few hours each day of free time?  \\nDo you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards \\ncomplete financial freedom?  \\n\\nIf you answer YES to these questions, you could be\\nmaking $5,000 - $20,000 per week working from your \\nhome.  Kiss your day job goodbye - this sure beats \\nthe 9-5 daily grind!\\n\\nAll you need is ambition and commitment.  This\\nis no \"get rich quick scheme\".  You have to work\\nto make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do \\nit.\\n\\nYou\\'re probably wondering if it\\'s hard to get started.  \\nDon\\'t worry, it\\'s not! I will show you step-by-step \\nhow to start your first email campaign and how to\\nbuild a booming online business.

I\\'ll show you where to find hot\\nproducts that sell like CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay\\nstarting an Internet business because they have \\nnothing to sell, but I\\'m removing that hurdle right now.  \\nAfter reading the Bulkbook, you can build your complete \\nproduct line in less than two hours!

              "  \"ilug ,\\n\\n From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,\\n          Johannesburg,South Africa.\\n\\nMy Dear ,\\n\\nGood day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.\\n\\nMy name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block and !\\nconfiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.\\n\\nDuring my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Eight Million and Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$8.600.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugabe's!\\n regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.\\n\\nNow this is what I actually want you to do for me;\\n\\n1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.\\n2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. \\n\\nPlease,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.\\n\\nBest Regards, \\n\\nMr.Michael Kamah and family. \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\\n\\n\\n\"),\n",

If you paid close attention you might have also noticed the \\nabsence of the all important \"wedding band\" missing from their \\nrespective ring fingers!\" .And of course we have all heard \\nstories of young black men carrying guns, and knives, allegedly \\nmugging, robbing and carjacking people of all sorts! Did you know \\nthat many young African American women refuse to date African \\nAmerican males if they do not own or possess an automobile. In \\nfact many young Black women prefer only to date individuals who \\nrepresent the subversive side of society; commonly known as \\n\"Thugs\" or \"Street Hustlers;\" Also, did you know that many young \\nAfrican American males prefer to buy expensive luxury cars while \\nliving in government housing better known as the \"projects\" \\nrather than move away, purchase new homes, save, or even make \\ninvestments?\\n \\n    \"Attention\" This is Not another \"Boyz in the Hood\" Story!\\n \\nThese newly distinguished \"Black Generation Xers\" are suffering \\nthrough utter chaos. \"Baby Makers, Loser choosers, Welfare \\nAbusers...Images of My America\" is a collection of observations, \\nand commentary as told through the eyes of a young African \\nAmerican Male who experienced, and perpetuated many of the truths \\nthat many in \"Black America,\" and the world in general would have \\nyou believe do not exist. It is a riveting expose that sheds \\nlight on the oppressive, and often discriminatory nature of \\n\"Mainstream American Society.\" A society that has nurtured the \\nrampant disregards for self-respect, and enlightenment that many \\nyoung African American men, and women currently suffer from. The \\nwriter supports his arguments with direct references to the \\noverwhelming numbers of young black single mothers attempting to \\nraise children, with many being teens themselves; and the foolish \\ncriteria that is utilized when choosing their mates; oftentimes \\nbeing based on nothing more than the young black male\\'s tough or \\ncool neighborhood reputation.\\n \\nThe author also identifies the self-destructive and often \\ncriminal behavior that many young black men perpetuate on a daily \\nbasis like, refusing to pursue higher education, carrying guns, \\nrobbing, stealing, selling drugs, driving fancy cars, and wearing \\nexpensive jewelry. The negative and self-debasing behavior \\ncommitted by both males, and females is due in large part to a \\nlack of guidance resulting from having been reared in fatherless \\nhomes. These poor choices, and behavioral disorders coupled with \\nthe unnecessary burden that it places on tax paying citizens in \\nthe form of welfare abuse, and over crowded prison populations \\nare the center causes for the cycle of rampant poverty, and lack \\nof direction that currently exists in young \"Black America\" \\ntoday.

I got your address from South\\nAfrican Information exchange Johannesburg.\\n.\\n\\nDue to the previous war against white farmers in\\nZimbabwe by PRESIDENT ROBERT MUGABE and his supporters\\nto claim all the white owned farms in our country, he\\nordered all the White owned farmers to surrender all\\ntheir farms to his party members and his followers. My\\nfather was a victim of this oppression and inhuman\\nbehavior as he was one of the richest farmers in our\\ncountry,my fayher was totaly against the act by the\\npresidnt MUGABE. The president�s supporters invaded my\\nfather�s farm, burnt everything in the farm, arrested\\nhim and confiscated all his investment.\\n\\nEarly last year when this victimization of white\\nfarmers by president Mugabe started, my late father\\nenvisaged a worse situation, he arranged almost all\\nhis money concealed it in a box and smuggled it out of\\nZimbabwe through Diplomatic means to South Africa.\\nWhen he arrived South Africa, he lodged the box in a\\nprivate security company through the help of his\\nlawyer here in South Africa without revealing the real\\ncontents of the box to the security company, then,\\nwent back home. He registered the box as family\\ntreasure.\\n\\nWhile he was still in detention that led to his death\\ndue to torture, he directed me to his lawyer in South\\nAfrica because of the escalation of the crisis in\\nZimbabwe. He did not want my life to be in danger.

This is critical to YOUR success.\\n\\n==================================================\\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified\\nlist of names, and save it on your computer.\\nDO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.\\n\\nSave this on a disk as well just in case you lose\\nany data. To assist you with marketing your business\\non the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information\\nwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,\\nwhere to find thousands of free classified ads and\\nmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get this\\nventure going:\\n\\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n==================================================\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see\\nhow it goes, and we will assume you and those involved\\nsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let\\'s also assume\\nthat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)\\nresponse (the response could be much better but let\\'s\\njust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send\\nout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only\\n5,000 each.\\n\\nContinuing with this example, you send out only\\n5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\\n10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded\\nby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\\nresponded with orders. That\\'s 100 people who\\nresponded and ordered Report # 2.\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for\\na total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to\\nthat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a\\ntotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%\\nresponse is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\\n\\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each\\nfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.\\nThe 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\\nReport # 5.\\n\\nTHAT\\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00\\n(half a million dollars).\\n\\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50\\n+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000\\n+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND\\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO\\nMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL\\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\\n==================================================\\n\\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think\\nfor a moment what would happen if everyone or half\\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\\ne-mails each or more?\\n\\nThere are over 150 million people on the internet\\nworldwide and counting, with thousands more coming\\nonline every day. Believe me, many people will do\\njust that, and more!\\n\\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n==================================================\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and\\nthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.\\nPlacing a lot of free ads on the internet will\\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest\\nyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you\\ngo along. For every $5 you receive, all you must\\ndo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That\\'s it.\\nAlways provide same day service on all orders.\\n\\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,\\nwith your name and address on it, will be prompt\\nbecause they cannot advertise until they receive\\nthe report.\\n\\n===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================\\nThe reason for the \"cash\" is not because this is\\nillegal or somehow \"wrong\". It is simply about time.\\nTime for checks or credit cards to be cleared or\\napproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one\\ncan SEE there is money in the envelope and steal\\nit before it gets to you.\\n\\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\\nNotes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for\\neach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the\\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at least\\n2 sheets of paper.

My wife, Jody and I live in\\nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.\\nCorporation and I make pretty good money. When I\\nreceived this program I grumbled to Jody about\\nreceiving \\'junk mail\\'. I made fun of the whole\\nthing, spouting my knowledge of the population\\nand percentages involved. I \\'knew\\' it wouldn\\'t work.\\nJody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and\\nfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I made\\nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\\n\\'I told you so\\' on her when the thing didn\\'t work. \\n\\nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had\\nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she\\nhad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!\\nI was shocked. I have joined Jody in her \\'hobby\\'.\"\\n\\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\\n================================================\\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several\\nweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.\\nBut conservative as I am, I decided that the initial\\ninvestment was so little that there was just no way\\nthat I wouldn\\'t get enough orders to at least get\\nmy money back. I was surprised when I found my\\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.\\nI made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. \\n\\nThe nice thing about this deal is that it does not\\nmatter where people live. There simply isn\\'t a\\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big.\"\\n\\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\\n=================================================\\n\"I had received this program before. I deleted it,\\nbut later I wondered if I should have given it a try.\\nOf course, I had no idea who to contact to get\\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed\\nagain by someone else......... 11 months passed then\\nit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!\\nI made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the\\nmoney came within 22 weeks.\"\\n\\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\\n=================================================\\n\"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively\\neasy money with little cost to you. I followed the\\nsimple instructions carefully and within 10 days the\\nmoney started to come in. My first month I made $20,\\nin the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the\\nthird month my total cash count was $362,840.00.\\nLife is beautiful, Thanx to internet.\"\\n\\nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\\n=================================================\\n\\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR\\nROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM !\\n\\n=================================================\\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this\\nprogram, contact the Office of Associate Director\\nfor Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,\\nBureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.\\n\\nThis message is sent in compliance of the proposed\\nbill SECTION 301, paragraph (a)(2)(C) of S. 1618. \\n\\n* This message is not intended for residents in the\\nState of Washington, Virginia or California,\\nscreening of addresses has been done to the best\\nof our technical ability.\\n\\n*  This is a one time mailing and this list will\\nnever be used again.\\n-- \\nIrish Linux Users\\' Group: ilug@linux.ie\\nhttp://www.linux.ie/mailman/listinfo/ilug for (un)subscription information.\\nList maintainer: listmaster@linux.ie\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

However,\\nplease take a few moments to read this letter.\\nI was amazed when the profit potential of this\\nbusiness finally sunk in... and it works!\\n\\nWith easy-to-use e-mail tools and opt-in e-mail,\\nsuccess in this business is now fast, easy and\\nwell within the capabilities of ordinary people\\nwho know little about internet marketing. And the\\nearnings potential is truly staggering!\\n\\nI\\'ll make you a promise. READ THIS E-MAIL TO THE END! -\\nfollow what it says to the letter - and you will not\\nworry whether a RECESSION is coming or not, who is\\nPresident, or whether you keep your current job or not.\\nYes, I know what you are thinking. I never responded\\nto one of these before either. One day though,\\nsomething just said: \"You throw away $25.00 going to\\na movie for 2 hours with your wife. What the heck.\"\\nBelieve me, no matter where you believe those \"feelings\"\\ncome from, I thank every day that I had that feeling. \\n\\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be\\ndoing had I not.

Due to the popularity of this letter on\\nthe internet, a national weekly news program recently\\ndevoted an entire show to the investigation of this\\nprogram described below, to see if it really can make\\npeople money. The show also investigated whether or\\nnot the program was legal.\\n\\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are\\n\"absolutely NO laws prohibiting the participation in\\nthe program and if people can \\'follow the simple\\ninstructions\\' they are bound to make some mega bucks\\nwith only $25 out of pocket cost\".\\n\\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT\\nTHIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING\\nBETTER THAN EVER.\\n\\nThis is what one had to say: \"Thanks to this\\nprofitable opportunity. I was approached many times\\nbefore but each time I passed on it. I am so glad\\nI finally joined just to see what one could expect\\nin return for the minimal effort and money required.\\nTo my astonishment, I received a total $610,470.00\\nin 21 weeks, with money still coming in.\"\\n\\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey.\\n==================================================\\nAnother said: \"This program has been around for a\\nlong time but I never believed in it. But one day\\nwhen I received this again in the mail I decided\\nto gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple\\ninstructions and walaa ..... 3 weeks later the\\nmoney started to come in. First month I only made\\n$240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made\\na total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months\\nby re-entering the program, I have made over\\n$710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The key to\\nsuccess in this program is to follow the simple\\nsteps and NOT change anything.\"\\n\\nMore testimonials later but first, =======\\n\\n==== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ====\\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\\n\\nIf you would like to make at least $500,000 every\\n4 to 5 months easily and comfortably, please read the\\nfollowing...THEN READ IT AGAIN and AGAIN!!!\\n\\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\\n\\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND \\nYOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, GUARANTEED!\\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS:\\n\\n=====Order all 5 reports shown on the list below =====\\n\\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE\\nREPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the\\nperson whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report.\\nMAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON  YOUR ENVELOPE TOP\\nLEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems.\\n\\n===WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER, MAKE SURE ===\\n===YOU ORDER EACH OF THE 5 REPORTS! ===\\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save\\nthem on your computer and resell them.\\nYOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5 = $25.00.\\n\\nWithin a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each\\nof the 5 reports from these 5 different individuals.\\nSave them on your computer so they will be accessible\\nfor you to send to the 1,000\\'s of people who will\\norder them from you.

Once you\\nunderstand the way this works, you will also\\nsee how it will not work if you change it. \\n\\nRemember, this method has been tested, and if you\\nalter it, it will NOT work!!! People have tried\\nto put their friends\\'/relatives\\' names on all five\\nthinking they could get all the money. But it does\\nnot work this way. Believe us, some have tried to\\nbe greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not\\ntry to change anything other than what is instructed.\\nBecause if you do, it will not work for you.\\nRemember, honesty reaps the reward!!! \\n\\nThis IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You are offering a\\nproduct for sale and getting paid for it. Treat it\\nas such and you will be VERY profitable in a short\\nperiod of time.\\n\\n1.. After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this\\nadvertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the\\nperson in REPORT # 5.

This is critical to YOUR success.\\n\\n==================================================\\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified\\nlist of names, and save it on your computer.\\nDO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.\\n\\nSave this on a disk as well just in case you lose\\nany data. To assist you with marketing your business\\non the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information\\nwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,\\nwhere to find thousands of free classified ads and\\nmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get this\\nventure going:\\n\\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n==================================================\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see\\nhow it goes, and we will assume you and those involved\\nsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let\\'s also assume\\nthat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)\\nresponse (the response could be much better but let\\'s\\njust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send\\nout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only\\n5,000 each.\\n\\nContinuing with this example, you send out only\\n5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\\n10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded\\nby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\\nresponded with orders. That\\'s 100 people who\\nresponded and ordered Report # 2.\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for\\na total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to\\nthat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a\\ntotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%\\nresponse is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\\n\\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each\\nfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.\\nThe 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\\nReport # 5.\\n\\nTHAT\\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00\\n(half a million dollars).\\n\\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50\\n+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000\\n+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND\\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO\\nMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL\\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\\n==================================================\\n\\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think\\nfor a moment what would happen if everyone or half\\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\\ne-mails each or more?\\n\\nThere are over 150 million people on the internet\\nworldwide and counting, with thousands more coming\\nonline every day. Believe me, many people will do\\njust that, and more!\\n\\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n==================================================\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and\\nthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.\\nPlacing a lot of free ads on the internet will\\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest\\nyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you\\ngo along. For every $5 you receive, all you must\\ndo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That\\'s it.\\nAlways provide same day service on all orders.\\n\\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,\\nwith your name and address on it, will be prompt\\nbecause they cannot advertise until they receive\\nthe report.\\n\\n===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================\\nThe reason for the \"cash\" is not because this is\\nillegal or somehow \"wrong\". It is simply about time.\\nTime for checks or credit cards to be cleared or\\napproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one\\ncan SEE there is money in the envelope and steal\\nit before it gets to you.\\n\\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\\nNotes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for\\neach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the\\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at least\\n2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of\\npaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report\\nyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your\\nname and postal address.\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :\\n==================================================\\n \\nREPORT # 1: \"The Insider\\'s Guide To Advertising\\nfor Free On The Net\"\\n\\nOrder Report #: 1 from\\nRui Sousa Santos\\nP.O.

Lee\\nP.O. Box 19\\n52 Victoria Drive\\nLondon SW19 6BD\\nUnited Kingdom\\n______________________________________________________\\n$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES $$$$$$$$$$$\\n\\nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success:\\n\\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for\\nReport #1 within 2 weeks, continue sending e-mails\\nuntil you do.\\n\\n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks\\nafter that you should receive 100 orders or more for\\nREPORT # 2. If you do not, continue advertising or\\nsending e-mails until you do.\\n\\n** Once you have received 100 or more orders for\\nReport # 2, YOU CAN RELAX, because the system is\\nalready working for you, and the cash will continue\\nto roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time\\nyour name is moved down on the list, you are placed\\nin front of a different report.\\n\\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which\\nreport people are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO\\nGENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS\\nAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN. There is NO LIMIT\\nto the income you can generate from this business !!!\\n=================================================\\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: \\nYou have just received information that can give you\\nfinancial freedom for the rest of your life, with\\nNO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. You can\\nmake more money in the next few weeks and months\\nthan you have ever imagined. Follow the program\\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED. Do Not change it in any way.\\nIt works exceedingly well as it is now.\\n\\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report\\nafter you have put your name and address in\\nReport #1 and moved others to #2 .....# 5 as\\ninstructed above. One of the people you send this\\nto may send out 100,000 or more e-mails and your\\nname will be on every one of them. \\n\\nRemember though, the more you send out the more\\npotential customers you will reach. So my friend,\\nI have given you the ideas, information, materials\\nand opportunity to become financially independent.\\n\\nIT IS UP TO YOU NOW !\\n\\n=============MORE TESTIMONIALS===============\\n\"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in\\nChicago. I am an accountant with a major U.S.\\nCorporation and I make pretty good money. When I\\nreceived this program I grumbled to Jody about\\nreceiving \\'junk mail\\'. I made fun of the whole\\nthing, spouting my knowledge of the population\\nand percentages involved. I \\'knew\\' it wouldn\\'t work.\\nJody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and\\nfew days later she jumped in with both feet. I made\\nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\\n\\'I told you so\\' on her when the thing didn\\'t work. \\n\\nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had\\nreceived 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she\\nhad received total $ 147,200.00 ......... all cash!\\nI was shocked. I have joined Jody in her \\'hobby\\'.\"\\n\\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois\\n================================================\\n\"Not being the gambling type, it took me several\\nweeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan.\\nBut conservative as I am, I decided that the initial\\ninvestment was so little that there was just no way\\nthat I wouldn\\'t get enough orders to at least get\\nmy money back. I was surprised when I found my\\nmedium size post office box crammed with orders.\\nI made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. \\n\\nThe nice thing about this deal is that it does not\\nmatter where people live. There simply isn\\'t a\\nbetter investment with a faster return and so big.\"\\n\\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada\\n=================================================\\n\"I had received this program before. I deleted it,\\nbut later I wondered if I should have given it a try.\\nOf course, I had no idea who to contact to get\\nanother copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed\\nagain by someone else......... 11 months passed then\\nit luckily came again...... I did not delete this one!\\nI made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the\\nmoney came within 22 weeks.\"\\n\\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y.\\n=================================================\\n\"It really is a great opportunity to make relatively\\neasy money with little cost to you. I followed the\\nsimple instructions carefully and within 10 days the\\nmoney started to come in. My first month I made $20,\\nin the 2nd month I made $560.00 and by the end of the\\nthird month my total cash count was $362,840.00.\\nLife is beautiful, Thanx to internet.\"\\n\\nFred Dellaca, Westport, New Zealand\\n=================================================\\n\\nORDER YOUR REPORTS TODAY AND GET STARTED ON YOUR\\nROAD TO FINANCIAL FREEDOM !\\n\\n=================================================\\nIf you have any questions of the legality of this\\nprogram, contact the Office of Associate Director\\nfor Marketing Practices, Federal Trade Commission,\\nBureau of Consumer Protection, Washington, D.C.\\n\\nThis message is sent in compliance of the proposed\\nbill SECTION 301, paragraph (a)(2)(C) of S. 1618. \\n\\n* This message is not intended for residents in the\\nState of Washington, Virginia or California,\\nscreening of addresses has been done to the best\\nof our technical ability.\\n\\n*  This is a one time mailing and this list will\\nnever be used again.\\n\\nslaxflhxbkltlrolpefciayxx\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

At the time, we felt that the advertising industry created a huge opportunity for the company\\'s direct sourcing technology solutions, and so far the company has delivered. Although the company has raised just $2 million in the two years it has been developing its\\x92 technology, it has increased revenues sources dramatically by opening a financial services division expanding the Live Media Marketplace expected revenues to $3-5 mm during fiscal 2003, driving the line in 2004 to $15- 25 mm. This remarkable growth becomes more understandable when one views the savings that its direct sourcing model generates for advertisers and retailers. The company saves advertising buyers up to 70% in costs dramatically increasing wholesale pricing effect, by saving time & efforts, cutting telephone and faxing bills, while providing free mass sourcing opportunities for negotiating advertising buying and selling opportunities using a secure state of the art real time negotiating technology over the Internet, we\\x92ve never seen anything like it!\\n\\nHow does the company do this? \\n\\nXrayMedia (OTCBB: XRMD) The Company founded XrayMedia in March 2000 to create a \"mass source to advertising sector \" live negotiating technology and advertising purchase financing accents the company\\x92s\\x92 strengths, serving both large and small United States and International customers with advertising opportunities delivered directly from the media and the general public. *** With the use of proprietary software, it is providing sophistication to this industry which greatly expedites orders and finds opportunities based on the users\\x92 criteria which results in a savings to the advertising buyers and as well as the ad sellers which it serves. \\n\\nTheir \"source to business model\", eliminates two levels of hindrance (sourcing and limited opportunities) and provides its customers with mass advertising choices and live negotiating that is designed give a substantially low cost base for finding the right advertising opportunity for all business with no cost.\\n\\nWhile investors have thrown money recklessly at money-losing technology companies, here is a company that will increase revenues from $1 to $25 million in three years, and grow profitability substantially with little funding. XrayMedia is among the best performing sectors since September 11th, and we feel that XrayMedia is likely to break through its 52-week high of $00.19 soon.\\n\\n *** Listed on the OTCBB and trading with an extremely low market valuation under 10 mm.\\n\\n*** It has opened accounts with over hundreds of buyers and sellers including some of the largest media buyers in the world, major retailers and smaller retailers. \\n\\n*** Attracting interest of major investment bankers and analysts, also a possible acquisition target at some point by major retailers.\\n\\n*** Received largest order of advertising financing over $500k with more contracts accumulating.\\n\\n*** Revenue growth is expected to be dramatic $1mm to $5mm. \\n\\n*** The company is expected to report a profitable quarter, to grow revenues and earnings \"substantially\" when it begins its 2003 fiscal year in January.\\n \\nShares Outstanding:      \\t83 mm\\nFloat:                         \\t5  mm\\nRecent Price:               \\t$00.08\\nYear Low/High:            \\t$00.02 - $00.19\\n18-Month Target Price:  \\t$5.00+\\n\\nCompany Contact: Ray Dabney \\nToll free:  1(888) 777-0658     \\n\\n(h3)6926Zjpl7\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the \"fraudulent assertions\" of two organizations, namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island), claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse. The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.\" \\n\"A Honolulu-based attorney created the \"Kingdom of EnenKio\" in the early 1990s. It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf. The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the \"kingdom\" has disputed.\" http://www.goldhaven.com/issue4/Two.htm (disconnected as of 2/1/00) \\nThe purpose of this letter is lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a serious interest in the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading the article is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I am obligated to respond to incidents such as this. I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with \"**\") in color: **DOM is located on Karitane Island and now includes the Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the South Pacific 1000 miles south of Tahiti.** (Comment: The construction of this statement implies the Marshall Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean 1000 miles south of Tahiti, in which case a reader may be misled.) \\nCorrection: DOM is located on Karitane Island in the South Pacific, 1000 \\nmiles south of Tahiti, and now includes Taongi Atoll in the Northern Atolls of the Marshall Islands in the North Pacific. **However, the Marshall Islands government has condemned the \"fraudulent assertions\" of two organizations, ...** \\n(Comment: Just because the RMI government \"...has condemned the \\'fraudulent assertions\\' ...of ...EnenKio...\", does that make it true? Why would you want to quote anything from a government that has been internationally criticized [and documented] time and again for fraud, abuse of human rights, outright theft and is in default on almost every financial obligation it has ever made? What purpose do you propose to serve by attacking a concerned group of dedicated people fighting for the very lives of Marshallese natives who have been overrun by foreign invaders, bathed in radiation from nuclear fallout and abused by their own corrupt government?) \\n**...namely the DOM and sister nation, the Kingdom of EnenKio (the Marshallese name for Wake Island),...** \\n(Comment: Nothing could be further from the truth. we cannot speak for DOM, but as for the Kingdom, we don\\'t even know what being a \"sister nation\" means and for you to make this categorically false statement is not only a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio, it is a deceptive intrusion upon the sovereign, His Majesty King Remios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of journalism. Doesn\\'t anybody check sources anymore?) \\nCorrection: The Kingdom of EnenKio is an independent sovereign state and \\nthe same could be said for DOM. \\n**...claiming to represent the mid-Pacific nation amid an alleged investment scam according to an article in Agence France- Presse.** (Comment: The government of the Kingdom of EnenKio represents the people of EnenKio, who are forced to live in exile from Eneen-Kio Atoll, lands and seas that played a significant role in Marshallese culture for perhaps 2000 years. Furthermore, \"...an article in Agence France-Presse\" has no merit as it was authored by a source in the Marshall Islands government. My preceding comments apply. The Kingdom of EnenKio is not now and never has been engaged in an \"...investment scam...\". We have tried for many years to attract qualified investors and funding sources for programs that will not only benefit the people of EnenKio, but also will positively impact people around the globe. In fact, we are currently working with a former NASA Astronaut. One tool scammers have in their arsenal is to discredit visionary programs of legitimate entities so they can feed on carcasses of the ignorant. Many journalists use the same technique to sell their stories on sensationalism. Doesn\\'t anybody check sources anymore?) \\n**The Marshall Islands foreign ministry has issued warnings to countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of either nation.** \\n(Comment: The Kingdom of EnenKio has made no \"fraudulent claims\" of which I am aware, and in my post, I am responsible for all published information. I would personally caution any \"..countries against acknowledging any fraudulent claims made by representatives of...\" nations, companies or publications if I had credible proof to that effect. However, my preceding comments apply as to credibility of any RMI ministry source. Furthermore, the RMI has repeatedly attacked the credibility of His Majesty King Hermios, who happens to be the ancestral sovereign owner under Marshallese custom of over 1/3 of the land in the Marshall Islands, including recent attempts to sequester him against his will. We believe some officials in the RMI are afraid of what will happen to them if honesty and integrity returns to the administration of lands and programs to assist the people with their pressing needs and they no longer have their hands on the till. To perpetrate their jaundiced agenda is an irresponsible abuse of journalism.) **A Honolulu-based attorney created the \"Kingdom of EnenKio\" in the early 1990s.** \\n(Comment: Mr. Moore is not an Attorney, though he was living in Honolulu in the early 1990s.) \\nCorrection: The Kingdom of EnenKio was established by decree of the \\nowner of Eneen-Kio Atoll [a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and 6-8 other names], Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, who then was Paramount Chief of the Northern Ratak atolls [he passed away in December 1998] and was fully recognized by the RMI government. He declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. **It was based on a power of attorney agreement with Marshall Islands paramount chief Mursel (sic) Hermios, which granted the attorney broad powers to act on his behalf.** \\nCorrection: The establishment of the Kingdom of EnenKio was made \\npossible by Murjel\\'s appointment of Mr. Robert Moore, the adopted brother of Hermios, Alab of Taongi Atoll and a private citizen, to the post of Minister Plenipotentiary. The document of appointment was also a Special Power of Attorney which granted Mr. Moore very specific instructions to do whatever was possible to expel the United States from Eneen-Kio Atoll and establish an independent state on Hermios\\' and the people\\'s behalf. \\n**The Marshall Islands High Court has ruled the agreement invalid and ordered it nullified, which the \"kingdom\" has disputed.** (Comment: Since when is a Special Power of Attorney an \"agreement\"? The Marshall Islands High Court has no record or knowledge of the Special Power of Attorney, except as has been publicized by the Kingdom of EnenKio, and certainly exercises no jurisdiction over Eneen-Kio Atoll, which lies over 100 miles north of lawful RMI boundaries. The RMI has no political or territorial jurisdiction over the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll because the atoll, by any name you choose, was not incorporated into the RMI when it formed its government in 1979, nor was it subsequently incorporated by any act, law, mandate or otherwise of any present or former Iroijlaplap or Monarch of Eneen-Kio and any statement to the contrary is false, fraudulent and irresponsible.) Finally, I suggest you, as a journalist or publisher, do a little more research, not only into establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by \\'Marshallese\\' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files and documents mentioned above, all of which exist in hard copy (not in \\'cyberspace\\') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web site. Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and , if corrected elsewhere, that a link be provided to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. \\nSKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE \\nJune 3, 1999- Sir: The following report was sent to me in which the author mentions the Kingdom of EnenKio (thank you for spelling \\'EnenKio\\' correctly. The purpose of this letter below is to lodge a formal request for correction of false and misleading statements made by the author regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio. \\n\"Fantasy Island\" -- \"Melchizedek passport scam reveals how the Internet can take fraud to new frontiers\" By Bertil Lintner in Bangkok, December 10, 1998: \"Determined not to give up, Pedley moved his fictional nation once again, this time to Taongi atoll in the Western Pacific. According to a Melchizedek press release, posted on its home page, Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of \"the kingdom of EnenKio,\" another only-in- cyberspace country, which in this case claims the U.S.-held Wake Island. In real life, Taongi is an uninhabited atoll in the Marshall Islands.\" \\nhttp://www.feer.com/Restricted/index_corrections.html (link to article of December 24, 1998: \"Fantasy Island\", disconnected as of 2/1/00) Response to the author: I am unable to locate the \"Melchizedek press release\" you cited, indicating that \"...Taongi was leased in 1997 under a treaty with representatives of \"the kingdom of EnenKio,...\". Such an act would be impossible and implausible as EnenKio has no legal authority or political jurisdiction over Taongi Atoll in the Marshall Islands. Further more, Melchizedek (DOM) is not so uninformed as to publicly advertise an illegal act in the midst of attempting to find a suitable land base for its people to administer their form of government. \\nThe Kingdom of EnenKio did enter into a treaty with DOM on the 19th day of September, 1997, but it did not convey a lease of land. It declared a state of peace and established diplomatic recognition between our governments. However, a prior agreement, signed in May 1997, which had nothing to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio, transferred Mr. Robert Moore\\'s rights to develop Taongi from Mr. Moore to DOM. It did not convey a lease at that time and no such document is in existence. This was made possible because Mr. Moore is the Alab (one class of landowner) of Taongi and had a legal power of attorney pertaining to Taongi Atoll, from the principal landowner, Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief) Murjel Hermios, who was aware of and supported the transaction. Consideration, if any, under the agreement was personally retained by Mr. Moore, who is also the adopted brother of Hermios. Now, please understand, that while Mr. Moore was acting in the latter case on his own behalf, and that of the future use and development of Taongi, which would have generated an income to Iroijlaplap Hermios, Mr. Moore wears another hat as Minister Plenipotentiary of the Kingdom of EnenKio. Iroijlaplap Hermios, also wore (he died in December 10, 1998, the same date of your article) other hats: one as First Monarch, King of the Kingdom of EnenKio and one as owner in allodium of Eneen-Kio Atoll (a.k.a. Enen-kio, Halcyon, Disclerta, Wake and several other names). For you to state the Kingdom of EnenKio is \"...another only-in- cyberspace country...\", as you did in the above article, is not only a completely and categorically false statement, but it is a blatant sign of ignorance of the state of EnenKio. And, it is a blatant deceptive intrusion upon His Majesty King Hermios, the sovereign of EnenKio and Eneen-Kio Atoll, and an inexplicable and irresponsible abuse of your journalistic license -- unless, of course, your statement could be proved accurate. I suggest you do a little more research, not only into the establishment and development of the Kingdom of EnenKio, but into the prehistoric history and more recent U.S. invasion of Eneen-Kio Atoll, properly named by \\'Marshallese\\' centuries before arrival of colonial western powers and missionaries. Then I invite you to our Embassy in Honolulu to review the public files, all of which exist in hard copy (not \\'cyberspace\\') and most of which are referenced or published at our official web address: Be sure to view the documents at our Resource Center which show, in many cases, full-color digitized letters of correspondence with the 59 or so states in the world, many of which are first world. In closing, I would simply appeal to your presumed sense of morality and ethics and request the referenced article be amended or corrected and that the link be added to the relevant paragraph cited above in the article. SKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE \\nJune 2, 1999- Sir: The following statement (in quotes) was copied from one of your Footnotes to History -D and E (disconnected as of 12/1/00). \"Enenkio Atoll- In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific. After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally. The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims. The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai\\'i. King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island\\'s independence in 1987. The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.\" Comment: With all candor, I cannot figure how such straight forward facts such as we have presented to the public and over the Internet since 1994 could have possibly been construed into the above referenced text. While I am pleased to find you have apparently taken a very serious interest (unless your site is intended as some twisted joke, which I am assuming is not the case) in the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio, I am aghast at how distorted, erroneous and misleading your summary is. As a consequence of my service to His Majesty King Remios and the people of EnenKio, I will respectfully offer the following line by line correction. For your convenience, your text will be set off (with \"**\") in color: \\n**In 1898, the United States annexed Wake Island, in the Marshall Islands of the western Pacific.** \\nCorrection: In 1898, the United States invaded Wake Island, the \\nnorthernmost atoll -- actually named Eneen-Kio centuries before western explorers arrived -- of the Ratak chain of Marshall Islands in Micronesia and the Central North Pacific Ocean. The Author responds: \"Rest assured that I did not mean to downplay the role of violence in the American acquisition of the territory.\" **After the Marshalls became a U.S. Trust Territory, the traditional chiefs of the area agitated for recognition that Wake Island was a part of the Marianas chain, and pressed their historical claims to the atoll, called Enenkio locally.** Correction: Following W.W.II, the Trust Territories of the Pacific, which included the Marshall Islands, was placed under administration of the United States by the United Nations. While Eneen-Kio was well established as one of the Marshalls, the U.S. only knew it as Wake and, having lost many U.S. lives there in 1941 at the hands of Japanese invaders, kept control of it. In 1993, the Paramount Chief of the Ratak atolls pressed his clan\\'s historical and lawful claim to the 3 islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll. \\nThe Author responds: \"I don\\'t see much conflict between the two versions here.\" \\n**The U.S. government has consistently ignored these claims.** Correction: The U.S. government has consistently ignored claims from the Marshall Islands government, which failed to exert a claim during its move to independence in 1979, and from the former traditional landowners, including Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios. The Author responds: \"I will note this.\" **The protests took a sharper turn after the U.S. Congress in 1993 acknowledged the illegality a hundred years earlier of the establishment by Americans of the Republic of Hawai\\'i.** Correction: The Eneen-Kio claims gained some new momentum after precedents were set by the U.S. Congress, when in 1993 they acknowledged the illegality of the 1893 overthrow of the Monarch of the Kingdom of Hawai\\'i by a group of American businessmen and U.S. Marines, and in the following year returned the island of Kaho\\'olawe to the Hawaiian People. **King Murjel Hermios, who is paramount chief of an archipelago in the northern Marshalls, declared Wake Island\\'s independence in 1987.** Correction: King Murjel Hermios, who was Paramount Chief until his death in December 1998, declared the sovereign state of EnenKio in 1994, whereupon the people chose him as their King over Eneen-Kio Atoll, ratified the Constitution and established government as a limited constitutional monarchy. \\nThe Author responds: \"I will make the necessary corrections here.\" **The Marshalls recognized this claim shortly after the nation gained its independence. In return for his services as Minister Plenipotentiary in the United States, Hermios granted American businessman Robert Moore land on Taongi Atoll in the northern Marshalls, which Moore has declared the Dominion of Melchizedek.** \\nCorrection: After the death of the First Monarch, his brother Remios \\nsucceeded to the throne as Second Monarch and rules along with his brother, Crown Prince Lobadreo, over the Kingdom of EnenKio today. To continue the commentary: The parts left out were either wrong or have nothing to do with the history of the Kingdom of EnenKio itself. Since HM King Remios also succeeded to Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, he also has responsibilities over 10 atolls, 2 islands and over 300 atoll islets. But that is another story, which has nothing directly to do with the Kingdom of EnenKio. I have offered this treatise in hopes that you will find the time to correct your site per my suggestions. Please feel free to contact me or view our pages at the address above. Thank you in advance for your attention and interest in this matter. \\nThe Author responds: \"I imagine that you are asserting here that Moore\\'s Melchizedek project (which can be located on the web through the Sources & Bibliography section of my web page) is non-existent. Be assured I will look further into\\\\par this. Thank you again for your response, Captain Rydell.

The author, \"Mr. Joseph Biglar, Undersecretary\", is not known to us, has not heretofore communicated with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, nor with its Monarch, His Majesty King Remios, at any time and has no knowledge of any policies or state activities of EnenKio. There is no valid reason to assume that the said \"press release\" is indeed an official document. The Republic of the Marshall Islands has perfect knowledge that representatives of the Kingdom of EnenKio, headed by His Majesty King Remios, on the basis of his proper and lawful authority, have the right and obligation to speak in support of the interests of certain persons, many of whom happen to be Marshallese nationals residing in the Marshall Islands. Response to so-called \"Press Release\": \\nThis unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of the Marshall Islands is wholly false. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to little more than an unquestionable confirmation of the predilection for infringement upon Marshallese sovereign rights exercised by the current administration of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, which has been confirmed by the U.S. State Department. (See: Human Rights Report) This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the Marshall Islands Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. \\nThe RMI is unequivocally cognizant that the Kingdom of EnenKio: �� �� exists as a sovereign state as defined by the Montevideo Convention (1933). \\n�� �� was conceived as a separate independent state by its sovereign, \\nIroijlaplap Murjel Hermios, in 1987. \\n�� �� was established by way of a public authority, the Constitution \\nof the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll, ratified in 1994 by its people. �� �� has negotiated diplomatic and trade treaties with many other states, including the Dominion of Melchizedek �� �� has asserted political and territorial jurisdiction over islands and seas which lie entirely outside and well beyond the area defined as \\n- now quoting Mr. Biglar\\'s statement -

The newest OFCs, e.g., Niue and the Marshall Islands, are now sprouting in remote areas of the world, such as the Pacific. Even more \"remote\" are mere figments of fertile imaginations such as the Dominion of Malchizedek (sic) or The Kingdom of Enenkio Atol (sic), both entirely fraudulent in intent and practice.\" [note: OFC = Offshore Financial Center] Response: This unprovoked attack upon His Majesty King Remios, Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, the sovereign state of EnenKio and its noble citizenry by the U.S. Department of State is a reprehensible categorically false challenge of the sovereignty of the Kingdom of EnenKio. It is also unjustifiably inflammatory and amounts to an unqualified felonious defamation of the international reputation of His Majesty King Remios, the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio and organs thereof. \\nThe unmitigated audacity and arrogance of the United States to attempt to link the Kingdom of EnenKio with International Crime, narcotics trafficking, money laundering, tax evasion, international drug cartels, terrorists, bank fraud or any other sort of criminal activity, without even one microscopic fragment of substantive evidence to corroborate such deliberately nefarious statements is reprehensible in the least. This public posting shall serve as constructive notice to the United States Government that any attempt to interfere in the business of His Majesty King Remios, Iroijlaplap of the Northern Ratak atolls of the Marshall Islands, or any acts, decisions, mandates, announcements or directives thereby, shall be met with definitive responses equal to the degrees of contravention. \\nFurthermore, this matter will not be resolved until the President of the United States issues a formal apology to His Majesty King Remios, along with the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, and the Congress of the United States initiates a thorough investigation into the abuses of power, subversion of natural rights and illegal occupation by the United States of the islands and seas of Eneen-Kio Atoll. Congressional representatives to Hawaii, the nearest State of the United States to Eneen-Kio Atoll, and those of other states, have repeatedly been advised of the foregoing atrocities and conditions and have failed to respond in kind. The United States is obligated as the self-assured trustee of Pacific Island States in Micronesia to respond to the charges of \"ethnic cleansing\" and her responsibility to EnenKio is no less.

SKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE \\nMarch 1999 -- Comments to readers from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Subject: A \"State of War\" Declaration The Kingdom of EnenKio recognizes that an unresolved conflict of interests exists between it and the United States Government.�� The United States government, admittedly at a time of colonial expansionism, appears to have violated the laws of nature and The Law of Nations in \"taking possession\" of sovereign property in the Northern Ratak State, which then had formal treaties with the Republic of Germany.�� The explicitly immoral and illegal 1899 seizure of Marshallese homeland by agents of the federal government was the start of present day sentiments of deprivation of rights and dispossession of lands felt by many Marshallese.�� Because of continual neglect misrepresentation and outright exploitation, these scars on Marshallese society have not healed. Thus a current state of adversity exists.�� Following four years of attempts to cause the United States to evaluate the plight of the Marshallese of the Northern Ratak imposed by its actions with respect to Wake Island, the government of EnenKio, on behalf of the Marshallese King, issued the \"\\'State of War\\', a Declaration\" and broadcast it to the world.�� The people were displaced from their native lands and kept as virtual prisoners of war, not by virtue of being kept in, but by virtue of being kept out.�� It was through this pragmatic initiative that the Kingdom of EnenKio solicited support to heal the wounds inflicted upon the people and peacefully restore what was wrongfully taken from the ancestors of the Ratak Paramount Chief, King Murjel Hermios. In retrospect, the Declaration has had little visible effect.�� While a state of adversity does exist, the hope for American recognition of past wrongs remains on the horizon.�� The Kingdom of EnenKio does not condone nor tacitly sanction any act of belligerence by any person or agent of any government.�� Such unnecessary means would diminish any hope of mutual reconciliation and could diplomatically undermine the cause of peace within the family of nations.�� The Kingdom of EnenKio also does not wish to see any further damage to the remnant happiness of the Marshallese people. \\nWhile the Kingdom of EnenKio continues to seek accountability of the U.S. Congress to obey its own laws, to conform to the UN Charter, conventions of the United Nations relating to self-determination, preservation of human rights and protection against human rights abuses, it believes accountability requires the U.S. to meet the pleas of the people oppressed by the conditions of this adversity.�� The refusal of \\nthe U.S. to meet its obligations, even to the extent that a simple discussion for resolution is held over the subject matter with representatives for the affected parties, perpetuates the adversity, turns a cold shoulder to the facts of abuse and ignores the rights of the Marshallese people to whom the U.S. pledged in good faith to execute the 1947 mandates of the United Nations and its members.�� Your understanding is appreciated.�� \\nSKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE\\nDecember 19, 1998: News Release \\nSubject: Death of the Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio \\nThe government has declared a period of national mourning on the occasion of the death of the first Monarch of the Kingdom of EnenKio, His Majesty King Murjel Hermios. Embassies, missions and regional posts are instructed to display the flag at half-staff until 11 January 1999. Memorial services, held in the Marshall Islands where HM Hermios made his home, mark the passing of one of the most unpretentious of traditional Marshallese leaders. His remains will be interred in a family plot on one of the outer islands he so loved. Irooj Hermios was Head of State of the Kingdom of EnenKio, revered as Monarch over the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, esteemed as Iroijlaplap and High Chief of the Northern atolls of the Ratak Archipelago, beloved as our brother and trusted as a friend. His successor as Iroijlaplap is to be formally named by a Council of traditional leaders. Selection of a successor to the Monarchy of the Kingdom is in process and will be announced at a later date. In the interim, a Reagent will serve as Head of State. HM Hermios followed a long line of matriarchal predecessors as Iroijlaplap. Aboriginal inhabitants of the islands today known as the Marshalls, part of Micronesia in the North Pacific Ocean and first discovered by European seamen in the 16th Century, were found to have a well-developed societal structure. Many nations have since, mostly by force, prevailed over the Marshall Islands, imposed unaccustomed western ideals upon her populace and ravaged her islands of resources and beauty. Today this area is commonly known as Wake atoll and is illegally occupied by the federal government of the United States. In one of the most courageous acts in recent times, Irooj Hermios clearly understood he had a mission to succeed where his predecessors in interest had failed to secure the islands, seas and lagoon of Eneen-Kio Atoll for his beloved people. (The account of his acts to establish the Kingdom of EnenKio as an island state, independent of the governments of the Marshalls and the United States, may be researched at the official Internet site. On behalf of the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio, we are extremely grateful for his dedication to the people of the Marshall Islands and are personally moved by the memory of a man who will surely one day be recognized as having a legacy of furthering the interests of his people by the setting of processes in motion to re-establish Marshallese domination over Eneen-Kio Atoll. We are saddened that our brother has passed without his seeing the fruits of his devotion to Marshallese ancestry and traditions. In lieu of flowers, mourners may contact the mission at the address above or call (808) 373-9254. Sincerest best wishes for the holiday season and the coming New Year are extended to all in Peace. News Article \\nSKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE \\nJuly 14, 1998: Communiqu�� to Correspondents Recent articles defaming the government of the Kingdom of EnenKio have been maliciously published under the guise of a Marshall Islands government warning against \"fraudulent claims\". We have once more admonished the writer of the articles in the Marshall Islands for disregarding indisputable facts which clearly discredit his biased report. We urge you to disregard all discourse in the media regarding the Kingdom of EnenKio which are not validated. To that end, you are cordially invited to contact this office with your specific questions or concerns. For your advice, the following statement was issued by the State Secretary of the Kingdom in reply: The Kingdom has never knowingly made any fraudulent claim whatsoever. No claim we have made has ever been shown to be fraudulent, nor has any claim ever come under or faltered from a challenge by anyone anywhere in the world. We are working vigorously to regain occupation of the ancestral property of HM King Hermios, to resolve the virtual \"state of war\" that exists with the United States government and to be accepted as an honorable state among nations. \\nThe Kingdom does not pretend to be (quoting from the report) \"asserting authority over land ...within the geographical and political boundaries...\" of the RMI. We are however striving to expel the armed imperialistic invasion forces of the United States from the shores of Eneen-Kio Atoll so natural Marshallese supremacy can be re-establish there. As to allegations of fraud and constitutional violation, no one has dared to come forward with any such a charge. We say, let the issue be played out in the People\\'s venue for the record, not in a libelous weekly publication. While we do not wear our brief history on our shirtsleeves, our raison d\\'��tre is clearly mandated in the Preamble to \\nthe Constitution of EnenKio, which can be seen at our web site: http://www.enenkio.wakeisland.org \\nReferencing the news article in the Marshall Islands Journal entitled \"Kingdom of EnenKio sets up in New Zealand,\" of May 1st, the editor was advised, contrary to his report, that neither passports nor driver licenses can be purchased from the Kingdom\\'s web site. The Kingdom of EnenKio DOES NOT SELL PASSPORTS! If you have evidence to the contrary, our Foreign Ministry would appreciate your furnishing it to them so steps can be taken immediately to investigate the matter. You are advised if anyone sells or offers to sell an EnenKio passport, that such an act is patently illegal. \\nThe published statement, \"The group ...claims to represent Iroijlaplap Murjel Hermios and the atolls of the Ratak chain...\", is wholly false. I have explained this matter to the editor on several prior occasions and ample information is available at our Internet site to refute the statement. The Kingdom does not represent any area outside of its territorial boundaries, as the Ratak atolls surely are. Contrary to their libelous statements, the Kingdom of EnenKio was not \"created\" by Robert Moore and he is not a \"Honolulu-based attorney.\" HM King Murjel Hermios is the acknowledged hereditary Iroijlaplap of the northern Ratak atolls and is also First Monarch of the Kingdom, not of his own choice, but by a legal process and free choice of our citizens who participated in the founding of the nation in 1994. Such a noble and peaceful beginning is not too uncommon in world history. \"Enenkio\" [sic] (actually Enen-kio or Eneen-Kio, in reference to the atoll itself) is the first Marshallese name for a Marshallese atoll located roughly 300 miles north of Bok-ak (Taongi) Atoll. \"Wake\" is a fictitious moniker applied to the re-discovered Eneen-Kio Atoll by unknown western society writers. \\nSKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE\\nMay 4, 1997: News Release \\nSubject: Issuance of Gold Stamps \\nThe government of the Kingdom of EnenKio proudly announces commissioning of its Inaugural Issue of Gold Stamps. This announcement, made at the First Sunday Hawaii Stamp, Coin and Postcard Show May 4th, was the first pre-publication public notice of the issuance of Gold Stamps by the Kingdom. Stamps are expected to be off the presses by early June 1997. First day covers with new stamps affixed and postmarked official \"First Day of Issue\" by the Kingdom will be available for a limited time following the dates of release. Distributors, dealers and collectors are encouraged sign up as a charter member of the EnenKio Philatelic Mint mailing list. \\nBACKGROUND - The Kingdom was established in March 1993, and the government was chosen by the people, who then ratified the constitution in September 1994. However, due to U.S. military activities on the island and the presence of armed occupation forces, the government of the Kingdom lingers in \"exile\". Several nations have extended recognition of the sovereignty of the Kingdom, documents of citizenship are being issued and legations are located in Europe, South America, USA and elsewhere. \\nA NATION IN CONFLICT - The land in question, commonly known as Wake Island, is actually an atoll comprised of three small islands assigned names of westerners who visited them: Wake, Wilkes and Peale. Few people in the world today are aware that the native discoverers who named the atoll Eneen-Kio lived in the Marshall Islands, exercised constant jurisdiction and made regular use of it as a living food pantry and cultural site. By way of developing the atoll as a nation, the government is asserting that it is the indisputable holder of allodial title to \"Wake\" atoll and has the right to exercise its sovereignty at the will of the people. The United States of America began in a similar fashion not with a peaceful transition from colonial status. Lawful return of the land is grounded upon the legal precedent set by Congressional apology to Hawaiians for the 1893 overthrow of the Monarchy. \\n\"STATE OF WAR\" - By way of an official March 1997 Declaration sent to top U.S. officials, the Kingdom of EnenKio has acknowledged that a virtual \"state of war\" now exists over the islands on account of the blatant acts of aggression and illegal armed invasions by troops from United States warships. The primary objective of the notice was to request a Congressional investigation into actual events and related factors surrounding the federal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. Calls to end U.S. operations, vacate the atoll and negotiate return of the islands to jurisdiction of the Kingdom have fallen on deaf ears. Despite repeated notices, letters and legal advertising, all major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding alleged incidents of piracy, waste and human rights violations by federal agents of the United States government. INAUGURAL ISSUE - The Gold Stamps are based on events of the past and dreams for the future of peace in the global community as the millennium nears. For that reason, the universal gold standard was chosen as the basis for evaluation. Since the relative value of gold in world markets varies according to the value and stability of national currency units, the stamps will similarly reflect changes in price when purchased with any particular currency. However, the real or intrinsic value of the stamps will remain as constant as gold. The extrinsic value will be determined by philatelic collectors around the world. Note: Stamps are printed on paper stock, do not contain gold metal and are not intended for use as money. \\nCLOSING COMMENTS - The government of the Kingdom appeals to all people from every peaceable nation in the world to recognize the Kingdom of EnenKio as a sovereign nation promoting peace in the Pacific region. In doing so, it seeks a peaceful resolution o f the \"state of war\" with the federal government of the United States and asks that everyone with human rights concerns use their influence accordingly. The proceeds from the sale of Gold Stamps will help fund the restoration of the Kingdom and end the conflict in peace. \\nSKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE\\nMarch 31, 1997: News Release \\nAn official document entitled A Declaration, was sent March 22 to top Executive and Legislative officials in the federal government of the United States, including selected Cabinet members. The document asserts that: \"A STATE OF WAR EXISTS OVER THE KINGDOM OF ENENKIO ATOLL BY WAY OF ACTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\" This is the most recent attempt to captivate the attention of the federal government. One of the primary objectives of this action is to bring about a Congressional investigation into the true events and factors surrounding the illegal seizure of islands in the North Pacific Ocean by the United States. \\nThis latest position statement is one in a succession of dozens of disclosures, statements, letters and legal actions taken since the government of the Kingdom was established in March 1993, each with similar objectives. Calls for the U.S. to cease operations, vacate the premises, negotiate return of the island to the King, apologize and compensate him for use, abuse and illegal hold-over following legal action have all failed to receive cognizance or reply from the federal government. Likewise, despite repeated notices, letters and legal announcements, major news media have consistently ignored the events and failed in their duty bring forth the truth to the people of the world regarding the alleged piracy, arrogance and human rights violations by the United States. \\nThe land in question, commonly called Wake Island, is comprised of three small islands, Wake, Wilkes and Peale, named by \"Western explorers\" for Western persons. What of the native discoverers? The crux of the issue is that despite the passage of ownership via a complex Matriarchal land tenure system for over two millennia with jurisdiction by the aboriginal chiefs of the Northern Ratak atolls of Marshall Islands, the United States seems to believe it is justified in having seized the atoll in 1898, and again in1899. Historical records reveal that the multiple landings by United States warships, en route to the Philippines on war missions, and subsequent Congressional action, were the sole basis of the U.S. claim. The motivation was said to be for the establishment of a cable station to improve communications with its marauding troops in the East. Such a station was never established at Wake Island. It was destined to become a military installation. \\nHowever, formal protests of the seizure was sent to the U.S. President by the German Consul in the Marshall Islands and some measure of correspondence followed. But since the U.S. abandoned the area without establishing a colony or cable station and Germany was defeated in the first World War, the objections fell into oblivion. It is understood from written accounts of oral Marshallese culture and traditions, that jurisdiction and use of the atoll by natives continued. The U.S. did not establish a settlement there until, under a lease in 1934, the CAA (predecessor of the FAA) allowed Pan American Airways to build a base for its fleet of trans-pacific seaplanes. Clearly, the so-called annexation by the U.S. is grossly flawed, the occupation patently illegal and its \"ownership\" is held therefore to be wholly invalid. When the U.S. Congress apologized for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy in 1993 and the U.S. Navy subsequently returned culturally significant land to the \"natives\" of Hawaii, a landmark legal precedent was thus set for comparable action with respect to the return of Wake Island. The islands of Eneen-Kio, as the northernmost atoll in the Ratak chain, played a very significant role in the culture and religion of Micronesians living in the more \"hospitable\" islands of the Marshall group. While not being used for Navy target practice as Kaho\\'olawe was, the use of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll and the military mission at Wake Airfield are decidedly without substantial merit and whereby activities take place in secrecy, devoid of scrutiny, oversight or quintessential knowledge by the American public. Even after cultural intervention in the mid 1800s by Christian Missionaries, natives continued to use Eneen-Kio, authority to go there being issued by the Ratak Iroijlaplap (Paramount Chief). King Murjel Hermios holds that title today. By way of developing the atoll in sovereignty as a nation, the government is thereby indisputable holder of the allodial title to Wake Island. The U.S. cannot produce a title. The Hermios ancestral lineage, passage of title through the ages from aboriginal inhabitants and discoverers, who gave the atoll its Marshallese name, their continual use and legacy of jurisdiction secures the rights of ownership. \\nUpon the basis of events and actions by the United States, the administration of the Kingdom of EnenKio, by virtue of the Declaration, \"yields to the recognition that a State of War\" exists over the island nation. This is not, however, to be viewed as a waiver of rights or unconditional surrender. Sovereignty and independence of the Kingdom, over all other claims, is forthrightly reasserted. The belief is that truth and law is on the side of the Kingdom and that reckless abuse of power and a trail of human rights violations are chronicled upon the record of U.S. \"ownership\" and occupation. Native North Americans are all too well acquainted with this brand of federal brutality when it comes to seizure of land and denial of rights. In the Declaration, demands are made as follows: �� �� \"...to come to the table of peace to negotiate an honorable \\naccord for the survivors of the said STATE OF WAR...\". �� �� \"If unwilling to voluntarily negotiate for peace, to submit to Impartial international arbitration of the terms for surrender and WAR reparations to citizens.\" \\n�� �� \"...to cease and desist, effective immediately, all and\\nevery \\naction of every kind in or on EnenKio Atoll or within the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone...\" \\n�� �� \"...to pay that certain debt, perfected and established in commerce by failure the Department of the Interior �� �� \"...to lawfully respond to proper legal notices of more than TWENTY-SEVEN consecutive months and most recently referenced by a Certified Invoice, No. 97-US-03, dated March 10, 1997, for which it is obligated to pay.\" �� �� That the \"...Congress of the United States is obliged to immediately impanel an impartial body for the purpose of investigating the atrocities committed in the case of the violations of human rights and due process...\". \\nThe government of the Kingdom solicits every other sovereign peaceable nation in the world to give effective and adequate recognition to the Kingdom of EnenKio Atoll as an Independent Nation under God. It seeks a peaceful resolution of the state of war with the federal government of the United States and asks them to use their influence accordingly. Appeals are being made to the United Nations. News Article SKIP TO NEXT FILE �TOP OF PAGE \\nFebruary 6, 1995: News Release \\nOn behalf of His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, Monarch of EnenKio Atoll, titular head of State, Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of the northern atolls of the Ratak archipelago of Pacific Ocean Islands of the Marshall Islands, I bid you a warm Marshallese greeting -- Yokwe! The purpose of this notice is twofold: First, to admonish those of you to whom word of the referenced issues were made known, then failed to take action; Second, to encourage you to whom this presents to take appropriate action in disseminating reports on this issue. As long as you remain quiet, safely removed from the potential controversy insidiously lurking beneath the surface of one issue about which the federal government of the United States remains resolutely silent, your anonymity and that of your publication is well served. Summary of Events 1993-94: Two official press releases have been made regarding the establishment of a new island nation in the Pacific Ocean, EnenKio, formerly known as Wake Island. The first was issued on February 25, 1994. It followed two announcements: 1) officials of the US Air Force at Hickam AFB, Hawaii said in articles published New Year\\'s Eve and Day in both Honolulu newspapers that the USAF no longer wanted to maintain Wake Island airfield and wanted to turn it over to Interior Department or another military organization by 1 February and abandon it by 1 October, 1994; \\n2) US Army Space and Strategic Defense Command of Huntsville, Alabama issued an Environmental Impact Assessment for a proposed missile launch program out of Wake Island; part of the \"star wars\" program, I am led to believe. \\nAn emergency meeting of the leaders of the future nation of EnenKio was held and it was decided that earlier efforts to bring the atoll under the jurisdiction of Hawaii would be abandoned in favor of affirmation of independence, thus seeking self-rule under the natural landowner as king. Letters to Mr. Clinton, members of Congress, U.S. Army and the first press release proclaimed the status of ownership of EnenKio (Wake I., Peale I., Wilkes I.), denounced the Army\\'s so-called \"no significant impact\" scheme to fire more than 800 rockets of an undisclosed nature into and over the waters of the Marshall Islands (including its sanctuaries for turtles and birds) and asserted rightful ownership claims. \\nOn March 21, 1994, a formal resolution was executed establishing the nation of EnenKio as an independent nation under the authority of His Majesty Murjel Hermios, who had granted special power of attorney to Mr. Robert Moore, appointed Minister Plenipotentiary. The Constitution, Succession Act and other documents were thereafter drafted. On September 30th, a formal Declaration of Sovereignty was signed into law by Ministers and selected delegate citizens, believing (as did the USA founding fathers) that such power was an inherent right of the people. It declared the Kingdom of EnenKio a sovereign independent peaceful nation, it acknowledged His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as owner in allodium of the atoll, accepted him as Head of State and embraced the Constitution as the founding document for a form of democratic government. \\nDocuments and letters were sent to numerous nations of the world proclaiming the above actions. Formal documents of recognition were presented, offer of diplomatic ties made and support for reciprocation requested. Copies of pertinent documents were forwarded to the United Nations, UN Security Council, NATO, South Pacific Commission and others. Letters of personal appeal were sent to UN leaders. A special request for protection and assistance was sent to the UN Security Council. On October 10th, a commercial affidavit and demand for payment was sent via certified mail to federal officers of the United States regarding the illegal January 17, 1899 seizure, under force of arms, of the islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, the adverse occupation and continued disregard of international Human rights law, UN Charter terms and terms of the Compact of Free Association with the Republic of the Marshall Islands (Public Law 99-239; January 14, 1986). Having acknowledged receipt and failing to respond within a reasonable time, the U.S. is now in default under commercial law, owing in excess of US$100 million. The second official press release was issued on November 21, 1994, relating the preceding events. Of all the agencies to whom it was sent, only two, the Marshall Islands Journal, a weekly newspaper and Islands Business Pacific magazine are known to have mentioned the story, then only briefly. \\nRequest for Media Response: \\nThe thirst of the media for copy on topics outside of natural calamities, treed cats and daily courtroom chronicles of violence and deception seems seriously lacking. Is not the peaceful beginning of a new nation news any more? Is not the restoration of native rights of an aboriginal society whose roots reach into antiquity (to before the birth of Jesus) worth a little journalistic investigation? How about suspicions of insidious military-sanctioned activity which threatens the security and peaceful existence of nations of the Pacific in the name of \"world leadership\"? Or is it world domination? People of EnenKio have a few simple requests of you, the media, in an effort to draw international attention to this issue and thereby, hopefully shorten the delay in regaining active occupation of islands of their ancestral heritage: \\n1. Investigate and verify the circumstances of the illegal armed invasion supported by U.S. expansionism and subsequent improper annexation of the sacred islands of Eneen-Kio Atoll, then being utilized by sailors, hunters and chiefs of the Marshallese civilization and for at least 2000 years prior to the 1899 fiasco. (Note: These facts and validity of the Hermios claim are a matter of historical record, not a fabrication.) \\n2. Investigate and/or verify the circumstances of any evidence of specific beneficial use and U.S. policy, past and present, or the lack thereof, with regard to the role of EnenKio . (Note: It is my understanding Wake was \"decommissioned\" after the so-called \"processing\" of thousands of South Vietnamese refugees in the late 1970s). \\n3. Reflect on the contrasting history of U.S. occupation, war, technological advances, in light of modern attitudes about misdeeds against native peoples and the willingness of our people to develop serious national economic programs for the benefit of all mankind. \\n4. Respectfully and conscientiously broadcast the credibility of the king\\'s claim of allodial title, the declaration of rights of the citizens of EnenKio to self-determination and the commitment by their government and leaders to promulgate their mandates in a responsible and fiscal manner. \\n5. Bring to light U.S. strategy with regard to the implementation of questionable and costly pet programs involving nuclear proliferation, offensive/defensive weapon systems, clandestine military research, environmental pollution and whatever else is going on there. (Note: Congress and certain federal agencies have promoted use of Wake Island and environs as platform for launching and testing hundreds of rockets and missiles, a federal prison for drug offenders and other less publicized projects.) \\n6. Fully disclose to the people of the United States U.S. strategy with regard to the denial of possession of lawful title to Eneen-Kio Atoll by King Hermios as a consequence of natural inheritance via time-honored and respected Marshallese matriarchal traditions, disregard for Human rights protected under international law, United Nations Charter and conventions and the U.S. Compact with the Marshall Islands and refusal to acknowledge liability for acts of piracy on the high seas of military and colonial expansionism of the nineteenth century. (Note: U.S. apology for the illegal armed overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy the prior year and the return of the Hawaiian island, Kaho\\'olawe, also of religious significance, has set precedents for the action demanded by EnenKio citizens.) \\nParting Shot: \\nWhat truly concerns me is the cavalier attitude of government in general, the U.S. federal government more precisely, which somehow behaves as if endowed by a divinely inspired alchemy that conveys the right to rearrange lands, cultures and economics with out the slightest inclination to counsel with those people most concerned. Such an approach might be expected in some dictatorship in some distant corner of the globe, but considering its present source, it is downright alarming. It is worthwhile to mention here that despite a prominent trail left over the course of more than two years, letters, reports, forms, published articles, press releases, legal notices, documents and virtually every action initiated by those representing King Hermios have escaped official response from officers of the U.S. federal government. Our not-too-distant past is replete with examples of the insatiable thirst of western \"civilized\" nations for doctrines faithful to the cry of \"manifest destiny\" which clearly marked American foreign policy of a century ago. If this current trend signifies a resurgence, it can only be considered a giant leap backward, considering the flimsy record of American attempts at \"fixing up the world\". The title of ownership and inheritance of Eneen-Kio Atoll pre-dates formation of the United States by two centuries or more. It is time the significance of native cultures and recognition of their right to self-determination is elevated from matters of scientific discourse to mainstream political involvement in determining the future course of human endeavor. People have a right to know; the media a responsibility to show them. In conclusion, I reiterate that our focus, from my point of view, is one, not so much of opposition to the ominous might of U.S. political philosophy and military prowess, but of asserting the moral imperatives for correcting errors of the past, supporting restoration of Human cultural dignity and the unobstructed observance of God-given individual rights. Thank you for your support and cooperation in helping end the siege and forced exile of our proud citizenry. \\nTOP OF PAGE\\nNovember 21, 1994: News Release \\nIn a bid to regain occupation of that portion of his ancestral lands which include Wake Island, site of a U.S. military outpost, His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios, through his legal representative, Minister Plenipotentiary, Robert Moore, the U.S. has been given the boot out of Wake Island. Moore served legal notice on top U.S. government officials in October 1994 to cease all activity and leave the islands. The filing came on the heels of a five-year struggle to gain recognition of the illegal seizure of islands (owned by predecessors of King Hermios) by the gun boat, USS Bennington in 1899. \\nThe legal document, a Commercial Affidavit, Declaration of Fair Value and Demand for Payment, was served under recognized principles of Common Law and International Commercial Codes. It details the specifics of King Hermios\\' ancestral rights to Wake Island, the illegality of the U.S. claim and violations of native laws, International Agreements and human rights during their 95-year hold on the Hermios property. It also establishes default, recognized under law, by reason of failure to answer the sworn claims, thereby allowing the Hermios claim to stand valid before the law as unchallenged. Under those claims, demand was made for payment of 94.7 million dollars for past use of the land. Continued use and holdover of the atoll will add 5 million dollars per month through 1995. \\nWhile putting forth the appearance of advocating human rights, U.S. officials continue to ignore issues right in their own backyard which keep King Hermios and the citizens of EnenKio living in compulsory exile. \\nEneen-Kio Atoll, a name derived from Marshallese traditions involving a small orange (kio) flower found there, is made up of 3 islands, including Wake. Predecessors in interest of King Hermios, aboriginal chiefs and islanders sailed native canoes to Eneen-Kio Atoll for religious and cultural purposes as much as 500 years BC. During the colonial invasion of Pacific islands, western traders and explorers consistently ignored the native traditions and rights of the real discoverers of those fragile and isolated bits of sand, the islanders themselves. A case in point is in that of the Hawaiians, who recently gained an apology from the U.S. Congress and President Bill Clinton for the illegal U.S. government overthrow of the Hawaiian Monarchy. King Hermios is presently acknowledged as the hereditary Paramount Chief (Iroijlaplap) of all the Northern Atolls of the Ratak Archipelago of the Marshall Islands, which terminates to the north, beyond Eneen-Kio Atoll. Mr. Moore has full authority to act on the King\\'s behalf to rid the islands of their illegal and unwanted Occupation Forces in favor of restoring the King\\'s assertion of his native allodial rights. Most recently occupying and holding the islands are agents of the U.S. Air Force command, 15th Logistics Group, Hickam AFB, Hawaii. Nearly identical articles published in the Star Bulletin and Honolulu Advertiser on December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1994 headlined: \"Air Force willing to give up its hold on Wake Island\" and stated: \"Not much activity there anymore, so the Air Force wants to give up control\". According to some theories thought to have reliable foundation, private entities or other government agencies are fighting for control behind a stonewall of apathy, denial and contempt for traditional ancestral heritage of King Hermios, his predecessors and people. Mr. Moore is also charged with the responsibility of bringing the nation under active jurisdiction of its own independent government, to initiate and administer to its citizens, promote economic development and to direct all affairs of State. The democratic government is established as a limited constitutional monarchy and is being directed by its Executive Council. \\nSince 1987, despite repeated efforts to resolve the conflict and the effects of a stroke, Mr. Moore has been unsuccessful in getting any substantive reply from officers of the United States, military officers and members of Congress. The following is a summary of some of the recent letters, inquiries and statements of claims made on behalf of the lawful and rightful landowner, King Murjel Hermios: �� �� Formal letters to President Clinton and Vice-President Al Gore in February 1993, requesting consideration under programs promised in their campaign for economic conversion of old military bases were ignored. As a military base, Wake Airfield was \"decommissioned\" more than a decade ago. \\n�� �� In response to the Environmental Assessment of the proposed \\nTheater Missile Defense Rocket Launch Activities, formal letters of protest sent to the Pentagon and U.S. Army officials, who contemplated launching hundreds of missiles from Wake Island over several years into the waters of the Marshall Islands, went unanswered. �� �� Letters to members of the U.S. Congress protesting rocket launch activities and requesting help went unanswered. �� �� A Resolution dated March 21, 1994 was signed which declared the status of EnenKio to be that of an independent nation under the administrative jurisdiction of King Murjel Hermios. It was likewise ignored. After waiting for more than 580 days since \"formal\" notification of the declared status of EnenKio and having heard no objection from the United States, Mr. Moore assembled the Ministers of the Executive Council. They, along with a few involved citizens living in exile and denied access to Eneen-Kio, formally passed and signed the Declaration of Sovereignty on September 30, 1994. They also accepted the draft of the Constitution which establishes the democratic principles of government recognizing His Majesty, King Murjel Hermios as Head of State and his family as the First Royal Family of EnenKio . While the King and his people bear no ill will against the multitudes of foreign invaders of Eneen-Kio Atoll, which over the centuries included agents of the Emperor of Japan, the Emperor of Germany, and the King of Spain, they believe the time has come to acknowledge the errors of the past, correct the conditions thereby produced and move on into the future in support of the sacred principals of Truth, Honor and Peace. Those principals are embodied in the Constitutions of EnenKio and of the United States. Those tenets were likewise embodied, affirmed and ratified by the U.S. Congress in Public Law 99-239 (Jan. 14, 1986), signed by President Ronald Reagan as the Compact of Free Association with the Marshall Islands and Federated States of Micronesia. The compact acknowledges superiority of all Marshallese \"natural\" rights, including those of ownership and use of land. \\nStill mindful of the terrible threat of extraordinary U.S. military 1 808 923-0476 fax/phone \\nRobert Moore, Minister Plenipotentiary, Kingdom of EnenKio Foreign Trade Mission \\nDO-MO-CO Manager, Remios Hermios Eleemosynary Trust, Majuro, Marshall Islands \\nhttp://www.enenkio.org \\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Siden\\nKrondikesvagen 54 A\\n83147 Ostersund\\nSweden\\n________________________________________________\\nEND OF LIST OF FIVE NAMES*********************\\n\\nStep 2.  These Guides will be emailed to you.  Save these\\nGuides on your computer\\'s hard disk as other people will be\\nordering these Guides from you, paying you for them and\\nyou will need to email the Guides to the new buyers.\\n\\nStep 3.  From the list of names above, delete the name and\\naddress of the person shown under GUIDE#5, and replace that\\nslot with the name and address of the person from GUIDE #4\\'s\\nslot.  Be sure to copy the name and address exactly as shown.\\nCheck the address again.\\n\\nStep 4.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #4, and\\nreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #3\\'s slot.\\n\\nStep 5.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #3, and\\nreplace with the name and address from  GUIDE#2\\'s slot.\\n\\nStep 6.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #2, and\\nreplace with the name and address from GUIDE #1\\'s slot.\\n\\nStep 7.  Delete name and address under GUIDE #1, and\\nreplace with YOUR OWN NAME AND ADDRESS. This\\nstep is how your own name and address is entered into the\\nlist of names to receive orders for the Guides. Eventually,\\nyour own name will go down the list of names until you have\\nreached GUIDE #5, and then be dropped from the list. The\\nkey point is that the number of people ordering Guides from\\nyou will grow larger the lower down the list your name goes.\\n\\nStep 8.  Once you have completed this new list, send out\\nthis new email (which shows your name under GUIDE #1) to\\nas many email addresses as possible, as many as 100,000\\nemails or even more.  The greater the number of mailings\\nyou make, potentially the greater the number of people who\\nwill order the GUIDE #1 from you.  These people will then\\nmake new emails to send out to their addresses with the email\\nshowing your name under GUIDE #2, and so on.\\n\\nThis is all you need to do.  If you wish to read the rest of\\nthis email message, then do so.  If not, just do the 8 steps\\nshown above. Remember, the key point is to send out as\\nmany emails as possible in step 8, and to encourage and help\\nthose who purchase the Guides from you to send out\\nemails of their own.\\n\\nDo NOT change anything other than what is instructed.\\nBecause if you do, it will not work for you.  Your immediate\\nreaction might be: Why not replace all the names on the list\\nwith the names of your spouse, kids, relatives, and friends.\\nThat might seem to you like a clever move because new\\nbuyers will be sending their money to these people.  But\\nthat move is the exact opposite of what is to your benefit.\\nWhat will benefit you most is having people who will send\\nout emails, seek new buyers, and provide assistance to new\\nbuyers. If the people you slip into that list aren\\'t going to\\nbe sending new emails, you\\'re only hurting yourself by\\neffectively closing down the program with your name on\\ntop of the list of the names that you have inserted.  There\\nwouldn\\'t be new buyers coming in. So, your sly maneuver\\nwill gain you exactly zero!  Furthermore, if you have done\\nthe work, and your name has worked its way to further\\ndown the list, by then you deserve the rewards and\\nearnings from that effort, and it would be unethical for\\nanyone to remove your name for whatever reason.  Don\\'t\\ndo it to others. Remember, honesty reaps the reward!!!\\n\\nYou may have a concern that after sending the total $50 to\\nthe five people on the list that one of the people will just\\ntake your money, and not send you the Guide.  Well, rest\\nassured.  As we said above, it\\'s to our benefit to have you\\nas a satisfied buyer who will actively send out emails to find\\nnew buyers.  So don\\'t think the people on the list will try to\\ncheat you or to \"stiff\" you for $10.00.  The people on the list\\nwould rather have you working hard because your effort will\\nbenefit them as well as you.  Later on, when other buyers send\\nyou the order to buy the Guides, fulfill your end of the deal\\nby sending the ordered Guide to the buyer.  Don\\'t cheat.\\nProvide efficient and honest service and we will all benefit.\\n******END OF SUMMARY************************\\n\\n=======REST OF MESSAGE======================\\n\\nWith easy-to-use email tools and opt-in email, success in\\nthis business is now well within the capabilities of ordinary\\npeople who may not have done any internet marketing before.\\nAnd the earnings potential is staggering!\\n\\nREAD THIS EMAIL TO THE END! -\\nfollow what it says  - and you will not worry whether a\\nRECESSION is coming or not, or whether or not you can\\nafford to buy that new car or home that you have been\\nlooking for.  Yes, I know what you are thinking. I never\\nresponded to one of these before either. One day though,\\nsomething made me feel: \"You use $50 going to a movie\\nfor 2 hours with your spouse, friend, or child, plus a simple\\nmeat at a restaurant.  Why the heck not?\"  No matter where\\nyou believe those \"feelings\" came from, I thank every day\\nthat feeling came over me.\\n\\nI cannot imagine where I would be or what I would be doing\\nhad I not. Read on. It works.  And when you read the Guides,\\nYou\\x92ll learn how to become a more effective communicator.\\nWhat can be better?  A way to improve your self-image and\\nconfidence and at the same time have the potential to recover\\nyour investment and make some good money: making over\\nhalf a million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home.\\nIf you work on this program, you will learn a lot about direct\\nmarketing on the internet.  If you believe direct marketing\\nvia the internet is the way sales and marketing will be done\\nin the future, then the experience you will gain here could\\nbe a real boost in your work career, possibly even providing\\na new career for you.\\n\\n= PRINT THIS MESSAGE FOR FUTURE REFERENCE =\\n\\nIf you want to make serious money, read this message until\\nyou understand it completely and feel confident to follow\\nthrough on what it advises.\\n\\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION ABOVE AND\\nYOUR FINANCIAL DREAMS CAN COME TRUE!\\n\\nRemember, this method has been tested, and if you alter it,\\nit will NOT work!  This IS a legitimate BUSINESS. You\\nare offering a product for sale to a buyer. Treat it as such\\nand you can see money coming to you  in a reasonable period\\nof time, depending on the collective efforts of yourself and\\nthe others on the list of five.\\n\\n===========================================\\n*** Take this entire email, with the modified list of names,\\nand save it on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER\\nCHANGES.  There are 2 methods to get this venture going:\\n\\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK EMAIL LEGALLY\\n===========================================\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you start small, to see how it goes, and that\\nyou and those involved send out only 5,000 emails each.\\nLet\\'s also assume that the mailing receives only a 0.1%\\n(1/10 of 1%) response (the response could be much better\\nbut let\\'s just say it is only 0.1%). Also many people will\\nsend out hundreds of thousands of emails instead of only\\n5,000 each.\\n\\nOut of your 5,000 emails and a 0.1% response, that is only\\n5 orders for Guide # 1. Those 5 people who responded also\\nsend out 5,000 emails each for a total of 25,000. Out of\\nthose 25,000 emails only 0.1% responded with orders.\\nThat\\'s 25 people who responded and ordered Guide # 2.\\n\\nThose 25 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is 125 orders\\nfor Guide # 3. Those 125 people send 5,000 emails each\\nfor a total of 625,000 emails sent out. The 0.1% response\\nis 625 orders for Guide # 4.\\n\\nThose 625 people send out 5,000 emails each for a total\\nof 3,125,000 emails. The 0.1% response to that is  3,125\\norders for Guide # 5, or $31,250 at $10 per Guide.  This\\nmay seem a small amount to you, but remember we used a\\nvery low response rate with a small number of emails being\\nsent out.  See what happens if you can get the response rate\\nup just slightly.\\n\\nIf Response Rate is 0.1%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:\\n$50+250+1,250+6,250+31,250 = $39,050 (as above)\\n\\nIf Response Rate is 0.15%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:\\n$75+560+4,220+31,640+237,300 = $273,795\\n\\nIf Response Rate is 0.2%, income from Guides #1 - #5 is:\\n$100+1,000+10,000+100,000+1,000,000 = $1,111,100\\n\\nDare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone\\nor half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\\nemails each or more?  From the example above, you can see\\nthe power of leveraging, that is, how much greater is the\\namount of money from a small increase in the response rate.\\n\\nThere are over 200 million people on the internet worldwide\\nand counting, with thousands more coming online every day.\\n\\nMETHOD # 2: PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n===========================================\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and there are\\nMany FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on\\nthe internet will get a response. We strongly suggest you start\\nwith  Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along.\\nFor every $10 you receive, all you must do is email the\\nGuide the buyer ordered. Always provide same day service.\\n\\nThe people you buy these Guides from will assist and advise\\nyou how to get the large number of email addresses that\\nyou need to send the new email containing your name and\\naddress.  In return, when others buy the Guides from you,\\nyou also should help those buyers to resell the Guides to\\ntheir email addresses.  This will benefit you because your\\nname would be further down the list, and their new buyers\\nwill buy from you.  This is no different than \"customer\\nservice\" in the retail or the  \"bricks and mortars\" business.\\n\\n===========AVAILABLE GUIDES ==============\\nThe reason for the \"cash\" is not because this is illegal or\\nsomehow  \"wrong\". It is simply about time. Time for checks\\nor credit cards to be cleared or approved, etc. Concealing it\\nis simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope\\nand steal it before it gets to you.\\n\\nORDER EACH GUIDE BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\\nAlways send a single $10 bill (U.S. CURRENCY) for each\\nGuide.  Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the cash is hidden\\nby wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On one of\\nthose sheets of paper, write the NUMBER & the NAME\\nof the Guide you are ordering, YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS\\nand your name and postal address.  Be sure to address the\\nenvelope correctly and put the proper amount of stamps to\\nmail the envelope.\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE GUIDES NOW\\nFROM THE NAME AND ADDRESS LIST SHOWN\\nAT THE BEGINNING OF THIS EMAIL\\n________________________________________________\\nYOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES\\n\\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for GUIDE #1\\nwithin 2 weeks, continue sending emails until you do.\\n\\n=== Two to three weeks after you receive 10 orders,\\nyou should receive 100 orders or more for GUIDE #2. If\\nnot, continue advertising or sending emails until you do.\\n\\nOnce you have received 100 or more orders for GUIDE # 2,\\nYOU CAN SEE THE PROGRAM IS WORKING, and\\ncash should continue coming in! THIS IS IMPORTANT\\nTO REMEMBER:  Continue to assist new buyers with advice\\nand instruction on how to send out more emails. You can\\nKEEP TRACK of progress by noting which guides people\\nare ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE\\nMORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF EMAILS\\nAND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN.\\nThere is NO LIMIT to the income you can generate !!!\\n===========================================\\nA NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM:\\nYou have just received information that can give you\\nfinancial freedom to really change your life, but I don\\'t\\nwish to kid you:  This requires A BIT OF EFFORT. You\\ncan make more money in the next few weeks and months\\nthan you have ever imagined. Follow the program\\nEXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED.\\n\\nRemember to email the revised copy of this email after you\\nhave put your name and address in GUIDE#1 and moved\\nothers to #2 .....# 5 slots as instructed above. One of the\\npeople you send this to may send out 100,000 or more\\nemails and your name will be on every one of them.\\nRemember, the more you send out the more potential\\nbuyers you will reach.\\n\\nIT IS UP TO YOU!  ORDER THE GUIDES NOW AND\\nEMBARK ON THE ROAD TO FINANCIAL SECURITY!\\n\\nUpon your purchase of any GUIDE #1 through #5, the\\nCopyright owner assigns to you two important rights:\\n(1) The right to resell and to distribute via the internet the\\nGUIDE that you have purchased, and (2) the right to assign\\nto your buyer of the GUIDE, the further right for your buyer\\nto resell that GUIDE.  Included in your purchase of Guide #1\\nis a valuable report on how to market on the Internet. It\\'s\\nfree of charge and will give you the tools you need.\\n\\nThe right to print any of the material contained in the GUIDES\\nis reserved exclusively for the copyright owner.  Your right to\\nresell and to distribute copies of the GUIDE applies only to the\\ninternet and/or world wide web via electronic distribution.\\nYOU MAY NOT PRINT OUT THE GUIDES TO SELL OR\\nDISTRIBUTE IN ANY WAY.  You may print a copy of the\\nGuides for your own personal use to enhance your\\ncommunication skills.\\n\\n===========================================\\n\\n* This message is not intended for residents of localities that\\nhave legal ordinances prohibiting engaging in such programs.\\nScreening of addresses has been done to the best of our ability.\\n\\nThis message is only being sent once to recipients and thus\\nis no need to remove your email address from our mailing\\nlist.

On June 6  1999 a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATIONMr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his  employers, the FEDERAL MINISTRY OF AVIATION that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one willever come forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i have just sucided in getting this fund sent to holland through a security company called GLOBAL& BASIC FINANCIAL COMPANY., I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that i will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the owner of this fund in the security company. i shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the changes  and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate & administration in your favour. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Bran\\nch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please replyimmediately via the private email address . Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country.\\n\\nAwaiting your urgent reply via my email: \\n\\nThanks and regards. \\n\\nMR.IKE EJOH\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

Perhaps.  With \\nadvertising, online and off,  taking it on the chin\\nfor the past two years,  online content sites have been shutting down,  laying\\noff staff and pulling back on their offerings.\\nHowever,  this horrible environment\\nhas resulted in an undeniable trend:  content businesses are challenging\\npeople to pay for content.  Finally,  after five years of free,  people are beginning to understand that online,  as in the real\\nworld,  you get what you pay for and they are taking out their credit cards.\\n U.S.  consumers spent $675 million\\xa0on paid\\xa0online content last\\nyear,  a 92 percent increase over 2000 spending levels,  according to Online\\nPublishers Association,  and that figure is expected to increase exponentially\\nthis year.  Look at these success stories:\\n\\n\\nNew York Times Digital has \\nbeen steadily increasing its paid content services over the last year,  and \\nregistered a 16 percent increase in its total revenues for the latest quarter.\\n\\n\\nTheStreet.com brought over \\n$3 million in subscriptions last quarter,  an increase of almost 50 percent \\nover the year-ago quarter.\\n\\n\\nConsumerReports.com will \\nreach over a million paying subscribers by the end of this year.\\n\\n\\nRealNetworks' consumer multi-media \\nsubscription service has more than 750,000 subscribers,  bringing in $17.8 \\nmillion in the last quarter.\\n\\n\\nThe Wall Street Journal Online\\nadded over 6,000 new paying customers last quarter,  bringing its subscriber\\nbase to 646,000.\\n\\n\\nFT.com has signed up 17,000 \\nsubscribers in three months since it launched its premium site in May.\\n\\n\\nIn recognition of this trend we're hosting \\nthe third installation of our innovative Content Management Summit on October 10, \\n2002.  The event charts the changes in the content industry from free \\nto paid subscription services,  and the technologies that are enabling the management and monetizing of content.\\nOur previous Content Management \\nSummit (aka Digital Rights Summit) on October 18 last year in New York City \\nand January 29 in Los Angeles were unqualified successes.\\nThe Content Management Summit \\nIII,  taking place in New York at the Millennium Broadway on October 10, \\n2002,  will bring together the 100 executives from the leading content and \\ndistribution firms for a focused day of networking and discovering practical \\nsolutions.\\nThe event will feature presentations \\nfrom software and services companies providing services\\nand solutions for selling,  distributing,  managing,  and protecting content.\\nWe're thrilled that \\nMicrosoft,  TeleKnowledge,  eMeta,  and Liquify will all be demonstrating \\ntheir latest products and services.\\nThe event will also feature six intimate round tables focusing on various aspects of online content.\\n These panels are meant to provide an informal forum to discuss the challenges\\nfacing these specific vertical markets,  the changes in the sectors since\\nthe dot-com downfall,  and best practices in the industry.  The panels will\\nfeature leading practitioners in each sector,  and will also include an interactive\\nquestion and answer session with the audience.\\nAmong the round table topics will be:\\n\\n\\nWeblogs:  how they are affecting big media \\ncompanies,  editorially as well as in content delivery/production mechanisms.\\n\\n\\nFinancial news and information \\ncompanies:  how they are using technologies to deliver content to users, \\nand how the economics have changed since the stock market downfall.\\n\\n\\nBusiness information services \\nsuch as Hoovers,  Lexis-Nexis and others:  best practices in the industry, \\n niche product launches and revenue streams.\\n\\n\\nDaily news/newspaper companies \\npublishing online:  how speed dictates technology choices,  and the move towards\\npaid content and its implications,  among other issues.\\n\\n\\nConsumer and entertainment \\npublishers:  how do publishers determine the value of entertainment content, \\n the push towards paid subscriptions,  online advertising and other issues.\\n\\n\\nJoin us on October 10th \\nfor this very important event.

But before the purchase could take\\nplace the president died. My client has decided to\\nkeep this for himself as all his properties has been\\nconfisticated by the present regime. But due to his\\nincarceration he cannot travel out and effect the\\nchange of possession to his benefit.\\n\\nI have been mandated by my client to source for a\\nforeign partner that can help him facilitate the\\nchange of possession. The deposit certificate and the\\ncode needed for the execution of this endeavor are in\\nmy possession.\\n\\nThe funds in question is USD17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred Thousand\\nUnited States dollars Only).

              "  'It was the Spring of 1979.  \\n\\nI was just a tall, goofy looking kid in middle school\\nwith buck-teeth and freckles.  Each day in the\\ncafeteria, I walked from table to table ...\\n\\nStealing other kids\\' lunch money.\\n\\nNo, I didn\\'t rob them with a gun or a knife - I just made\\nthem a little deal.  \"Let me borrow two dollars today,\" I said,\\n\"and I\\'ll bring you five dollars next week.\"  The investment\\nwas too good to pass up, and other kids were throwing their\\nlunch money at me like gravy on mashed potatoes.  Of course \\nwhen \"next week\" rolled around and I couldn\\'t pony up the cash,\\nI promised to pay them even more the week after that,\\nif they would just let me keep their investment a little bit \\nlonger.\\n\\nEventually the end of the year came and went, high school\\nstarted and with it came girls, and homework, and parties,\\nand sports, and those poor kids from eighth grade had more \\nthings on their mind than last year\\'s lunch money.\\n\\nI made off with a tidy sum for a middle school kid,\\nand I didn\\'t even get beat up.\\n\\nHidden inside this story are the two greatest stock market \\nsecrets you will ever learn.\\n\\nFirst of all, greed is your number one enemy. You\\'re not\\ngoing to turn $2 into $5 in a week, so cash out when\\nyou\\'re ahead.  Don\\'t wait for the boat to sink before \\ngrabbing the lifejacket.\\n\\nSecond, never trust an investment adviser of any kind.\\nThey are looking out for their own money, not yours.\\n\\nThe \"professionals\", those stuffy investment counselors and\\nmoney managers, will always tell you that the best time to\\nbuy is NOW.  According to those guys, the longer you keep\\nyour money in the market, the more money you\\'re going to make.\\nAsk them when is the best time to sell and their answer is\\n\"NEVER\".  \\n\\nIn a sense, they are right.  If you put $250,000 in an index\\nfund right now, you\\'ll probably have over a million dollars\\nin thirty or forty years.  But here\\'s the problem:\\n\\nDo you want to WAIT thirty or forty years to be rich?\\n\\nHell no!\\n\\nYou want the money NOW - so you can enjoy it. It\\'s hard to\\nmake use of your fortune when you\\'re seventy years old \\nin a wheelchair.  If you could make a million dollars in\\nthe next few years, what would you do with it?  Where would\\nyou travel?  What kind of car would you buy?  \\n\\nThe fact is ... youth is the best time to be rich.\\n\\nIf your goal is to make quick profits in the market, volatility\\nis your ally, and stability your enemy.  You want to see\\nthose large upswings, two hundred points in a day, followed\\nby the four hundred point crash a week later.  You don\\'t\\ncare if the market went up or down 20% this year as long\\nit was UNSTABLE.  That\\'s how you\\'re going to make the \\nmoney.\\n\\nWhat I\\'m talking about here is day trading.  \\n\\nMy father invests the traditional way; he holds some good stocks \\nand he goes up 30K and down 30K. In the long term of 5-10 years \\nhe makes money. \\n\\nThe day trader buys or sells 5,000 shares of XYZ for a\\n$25,000 profit in a 5-10 minute trade.  He acts quickly, taking \\nadvantage of all the information at his disposal about a \\ncertain stock, and estimating whether it will go up or \\ndown within hours, sometimes within minutes.  \\n\\nI can teach you how to do this - and how to make amazing \\namounts of money at it.  It\\'s not rocket science, and you \\nonly need to learn a few basic principles to get started.\\n\\nSociety would have you believe that successful trading is \\ncomplicated and requires formal training.  \\n\\nThe truth is, wealthy people use very simple investment \\nstrategies to make money.  \\n\\nPopular media and investment professionals portray successful\\ntrading as difficult and complex to scare you out of the boxing\\nring.  They don\\'t want the competetion - and they sure as hell\\ndon\\'t want you paying a few dollars to an online trading firm\\nto execute a trade for which they\\'d charge you forty or fifty \\ndollars.\\n\\nThey make their money only if you believe two lies:\\n\\n1) That investing is too difficult and risky for the average \\nperson.\\n\\n2) That using an investment adviser who charges a high \\ncommission is safer than trading online for a few bucks \\nper trade.\\n\\nHere is what the financial gurus in today\\'s society absolutely,\\npositively DO NOT WANT YOU TO KNOW ...\\n\\nThe strategies for profitable day trading are in fact\\nso simple that anyone can do it - provided they spend\\na few hours of studying.  \\n\\nAfter reading over 200 financial books and publications\\nduring the past decade, and after using day trading\\nto successfully make more than four million dollars in\\nthe stock market, I\\'ve learned the following lessons:\\n\\n** Achieving financial success is incredibly simple.\\n\\n** Anyone can do it.\\n\\n** It only takes a few hours to learn.\\n\\nWhen I discovered the secret to day trading, I didn\\'t become\\nwealthy overnight.  If you want instant cash, drive to Wal-mart. \\nBuy a ski mask and a shotgun, and rob your local bank. The \\nonly way to get rich, quick or otherwise, is through\\nhard work, knowledge, and determination.\\n\\nAfter learning the fundamentals of day trading, I started \\npracticing the trading art itself, and the first few weeks\\nbrought modest gains.  The next few months gave me the practical\\nexperience I needed to really earn a living, and I was pulling\\nclose to a six figure income. In less than three years with no \\nformal financial training, minimal effort and only moderate risk,\\nI had made my first million.  The knowledge that I gained \\nduring those formative trading years I am willing to share\\nwith you in my new book, the Master Trader.  You will learn from\\nmy mistakes, and from my successes, as I teach you the simple,\\nsecret formula for day trading that I\\'ve used profitably\\nyear after year.\\n\\nThe income of the day trader can be staggering.  Thousands, even \\nhundreds of thousands of dollars can be made or lost within\\nminutes.  The difference between making money and losing your \\nshirt is simply this: knowledge.  I will provide that knowledge,\\nand I will give you a winning edge at this high-stakes game. \\n\\nAverage Income of a Day Trader: \\n5% average an income in excess of $500,000 per year\\n22% average an income in excess of $250,000 per year\\n35% average an income in excess of $100,000 per year. \\n27% average an income between $50,000 and $99,999 per year \\n11% average an income between $20,000 and $49,999 per year \\n\\nAfter reading the Master Trader, you will discover extremely \\nprofitable, simple yet powerful trading methods that give \\nyou an almost unfair trading advantage and make you \\nwin DESPITE the current market weakness. \\n\\nHere is just a snippet of what I will teach you:\\n\\n*** Make money whether a stock goes up or down.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to get in and out of stocks within split seconds.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn exactly what stocks to trade, the exact price to \\nbuy them and the exact price to sell them. \\n\\n\\n*** Save thousands of dollars by learning to avoid the \\nmistakes beginners make.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to trade stocks like a pro and how to make money \\nconsistently in every market! \\n\\n\\n*** Learn proven strategies that give you the highest chance \\nfor great success. \\n\\n\\n*** Profit on huge intraday price swings.\\n\\n\\n*** Make money on the biggest news stories.\\n\\n\\n*** Actively manage your risks and learn how to realize maximum\\nreturns. \\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to use the tools and information Wall Street \\nprofessionals use.\\n\\n\\n*** Learn how to develop and maintain a winning state of mind. \\n\\n\\nIt\\'s time to ask yourself: \"Am I going to listen to the \\nProfessionals who say BUY BUY BUY but never sell?  Or am\\nI going to take control of my own financial future, and\\nstart making money RIGHT NOW in the stock market?\"\\n\\nWho is looking out for your best economic interests - some\\nwealthy Wall Street stockbroker, or yourself?\\n\\nWith the Master Trader e-book, you will learn everything you \\nneed to know in order to get started with Day Trading ... from \\nchoosing the best broker in order to take advantage of the \\nlowest commissions and instant order executions to professional \\ntrading strategies that make professional traders millions of \\ndollars.\\n\\nThe Master Trader e-book is the most comprehensive yet easy to \\nunderstand and straight-forward book ever written about active \\ntrading. If you are serious about success in short term stock \\ntrading - ORDER TODAY and start paving the road to your\\nown financial future.\\n\\nOh, and remember that scraggly kid in the eighth grade?\\nHis high school friends laughed when he said he was going to \\nmake money in the stock market.  \\n\\nSix years later, he bought a beach-front home on the California\\ncoast - WITH CASH.  Oops, they weren\\'t laughing anymore.\\n\\nIn a rollercoaster market like we have today, day trading\\nis the fastest track to wealth.  If you\\'re looking\\nfor a long-term retirement investment with no risk \\nthat goes up 5% a year, then by all means, this ain\\'t\\nyour kind of game.\\n\\nBut if you want the QUICKEST possible way to make a FORTUNE\\nin the market, with the lowest element of risk, then\\norder the MASTER TRADER e-book right now.  I promise\\nto teach you ALL of the secrets that helped me become a\\nmillionaire through successful day trading.\\n\\nYou don\\'t need to know anything about the market, and\\nanyone can do it, with minimum effort.

MICHAEL BUNDU. \\nDEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO. \\nTel No: Your country Intl. access code +8821652098236\\nemail : mikebundu@rediffmail.com\\nDear Sir/Madam\\n\\n\\nSEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE. \\n\\nPlease permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This\\nis necessitated by my urgent need to reach a \\ndependable and trust worthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange\\nand unsolicited but I crave your indulgence \\nand pray that you view it seriously. My name is COL. MICHAEL BUNDU of the\\nDemocratic Republic of Congo and one of \\nthe close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of\\nCongo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may \\nhis soul rest in peace. \\n\\nDue to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in\\nmy country, I and some of my colleagues were \\ninstructed by Late President Kabila to go abroad to purchase arms and\\nammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five Hundred \\nThousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel\\ngroup. We were then given this money privately \\nby the then President, LAURENT KABILA, without the knowledge of other\\nCabinet Members. But when President Kabila \\nwas killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his bodyguards a day before we\\nwere schedule to travel out of Congo, We \\nimmediately decided to put the funds into a private security company here\\nin Congo for safe keeping. The security of the \\nsaid amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and\\nseizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava \\n(One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military\\nPersonnel from our same tribe, by the new \\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President\\nLaurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. \\n\\nIn view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who\\ncan assist us to move this money out of my country \\nas the beneficiary. \\nWE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' here to move the fund under Diplomatic\\nCover to a security company in Europe in your \\nname. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked\\n''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it \\nwill not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance. \\n\\nOur inability to move this money out of Congo all this while stems from\\nour lack of trust of our supposed good friends \\n(western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked\\nwith the late President Kabila, immediately \\nafter his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other,\\nthe information We gathered from an associate \\nwho has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with\\nyour sincere assistance, this transaction will \\nbe properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two\\nweeks. The said money is a state fund and \\ntherefore requires a total confidentiality. \\n\\nWe would please need you to stand on our behalf as the beneficiary of this\\nfund in Europe. This is because we are under \\nrestricted movement and watch and hence we want to be very careful in\\norder not to lose this fund which we have worked \\nso hard for. Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this fund out\\nof Congo, you can contact me through my email \\naddresses, Tel/Fax nos. above with your telephone, fax number and personal\\ninformation to enable us discuss the \\nmodalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.\\n\\nPlease note that There are no RISKS involved in this Deal as everyone's\\nSecurity is Guaranteed if we follow the required \\nguidelines. I will hence furnish you with further details of this Deal as\\nsoon as I am assured of your Sincere interest to assist \\nus. \\n\\nI must use this opportunity and medium to implore you to exercise the\\nutmost indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily \\nconfidential, Whatever your decision, while I await your prompt response.\\nThank you and God Bless. \\nBest Regards \\n\\n\\nCOL.

To assist you with marketing your business\\non the internet, the 5 reports you purchase will\\nprovide you with invaluable marketing information\\nwhich includes how to send bulk e-mails legally,\\nwhere to find thousands of free classified ads and\\nmuch more. There are 2 primary methods to get this\\nventure going:\\n\\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY\\n==================================================\\n\\nLet\\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see\\nhow it goes, and we will assume you and those involved\\nsend out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let\\'s also assume\\nthat the mailing receives only a 0.2% (2/10 of 1%)\\nresponse (the response could be much better but let\\'s\\njust say it is only 0.2%). Also many people will send\\nout hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only\\n5,000 each.\\n\\nContinuing with this example, you send out only\\n5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2% response, that is only\\n10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded\\nby sending out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of\\n50,000. Out of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2%\\nresponded with orders. That\\'s 100 people who\\nresponded and ordered Report # 2.\\n\\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for\\na total of 500,000 e-mails. The 0.2% response to\\nthat is 1000 orders for Report # 3.\\n\\nThose 1000 people send 5,000 e-mails each for a\\ntotal of 5 million e-mails sent out. The 0.2%\\nresponse is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.\\n\\nThose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each\\nfor a total of 50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails.\\nThe 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for\\nReport # 5.\\n\\nTHAT\\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH = $500,000.00\\n(half a million dollars).\\n\\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50\\n+ 2..... $500 + 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000\\n+ 5.... $500,000 .... Grand Total=$555,550.00\\n\\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND\\nFIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO\\nMATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL\\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY!\\n==================================================\\n\\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE\\nORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think\\nfor a moment what would happen if everyone or half\\nor even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000\\ne-mails each or more?\\n\\nThere are over 150 million people on the internet\\nworldwide and counting, with thousands more coming\\nonline every day. Believe me, many people will do\\njust that, and more!\\n\\nMETHOD # 2: BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET\\n==================================================\\n\\nAdvertising on the net is very, very inexpensive and\\nthere are hundreds of FREE places to advertise.\\nPlacing a lot of free ads on the internet will\\neasily get a larger response. We strongly suggest\\nyou start with Method # 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you\\ngo along. For every $5 you receive, all you must\\ndo is e-mail them the report they ordered. That\\'s it.\\nAlways provide same day service on all orders.\\n\\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out,\\nwith your name and address on it, will be prompt\\nbecause they cannot advertise until they receive\\nthe report.\\n\\n===========AVAILABLE REPORTS ====================\\nThe reason for the \"cash\" is not because this is\\nillegal or somehow \"wrong\". It is simply about time.\\nTime for checks or credit cards to be cleared or\\napproved, etc. Concealing it is simply so no one\\ncan SEE there is money in the envelope and steal\\nit before it gets to you.\\n\\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY.\\nNotes: Always send $5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for\\neach report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure the\\ncash is concealed by wrapping it in at least\\n2 sheets of paper. On one of those sheets of\\npaper, write the NUMBER & the NAME of the report\\nyou are ordering, YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your\\nname and postal address.\\n\\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW :\\n==================================================\\nREPORT # 1: \"The Insider\\'s Guide To Advertising\\nfor Free On The Net\"\\nOrder Report #1 from:\\n\\nRobert Borowczyk\\nul.

I made\\nmerciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old\\n\\'I told you so\\' on her when the thing didn\\'t work. \\n\\nWell, the laugh was on me! Within 3 weeks she had\\nreceived 50 responses.

This is the product and the VALUE that you have been searching for. This is the product that you will buy again & again!\\n\\nWe have been in the business (science) of developing non-cannabis, personal choice sensitive smoking agendas for a good, goodly while. Along this avenue of ethnobotany, we have always strived to achieve greater and greater \"Sensitivity / Responsiveness\" & Aphrodisia within our gourmet smokables and brews. And indeed, we have. Many of these previous products are still marketed today by companies who are less developmental than our botanical resource cooperative. Even our own two signature \"smokables\" (Ragga Dagga & Stoney Mahoney) are being discontinued. That Shangrila Zowie Wowie is by far such a superior product is undeniable, therefore it makes no sense to us at all to offer any other smoking product. Quite simply we have surpassed even our own expectations of excellence, thereby; our definition of excellence has evolved. This \"Shangrila\" project has been in research and development for sometime on two fronts. First, on an agricultural level, fields for our Gnarly SweetGrass!\\n must be planted and be allowed to propagate for several years before initial harvest can even be undertaken. This is how the botanical achieves \"potent significance\" much like the regimen of ginseng. Also, harvest time is limited and can take place only twice a year, as like the hemp plant, maximum potency is only achieved after \"flowering\" occurs. But, unlike the hemp plant, and for that matter, unlike most herbs, the entire base plant of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (leave, stem & root) is all \"viripotent,\" which makes this \"gnarly stoke\" a botanical phenomenon! As well, most potentiating factors of Shangrila, as well as the primary botanical factor of Shangrila, will not achieve \"viripotency\" if grown in our hemisphere, therefore; Shangrila is indeed a multi-national, multi-complicated, agricultural undertaking. However, all of this undertaking has indeed been worthwhile! Secondly, the potentiating, infusion regimen used to enhance the attributes of Shangrila has also taken a lon!\\ng time to bring into potent fruition as there are many balancings of the various molecular factors involved in the completion of Zowie Wowie. We are most pleased to be able to say, as you will note in the experience of Shangrila Zowie Wowie, that this process has achieved fruition.\\n\\nSuffice to say, without any hype or glype, Shangrila Zowie Wowie Gnarly SweetGrass is without a doubt, the most significant, non-invasive, non-cannabis, \"sensitive/responsive\", personal choice, absolutely legal (cannot fail a drug test), smoking (\"Smoka\") botanical on our planet ... probably in the universe! Hard to believe that this product is ABSOLUTELY LEGAL!\\n\\n* Mill-stoned & honed.\\n* Depressive regressive!\\n* Psychologically uplifting!\\n* Good-bye stress, anxiety & restlessness!\\n* Sophisticated, well-balanced \"ambiance.\"\\n* Inspires contemplativeness and creativity.\\n* \"Potentiated\" & viripotent!\\n* 4 – 5 draws lasts a good, goodly while.\\n* Sweet aphrodisia!

As is an herbalist\\'s way, four or five draws of \"Smoka\" should be inhaled and retained. For the non-smoker, it is most appropriate to engage this herbaceousness as a potentiated tea/brew. (Steep approximately one teaspoon of Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) herba per one cup of water for ten minutes or so & strain.) When smoking Shangrila Zowie Wowie (tm), please draw gently as it is a most preeminent \"Sensitive / Responsive\" Smoke. Both a personal water-pipe (huuka) (water-pipe is included with quarter pound can only) and a standard herb-pipe are included for your smoking convenience and delight. Smoke and Brew concurrently is absolutely a Sweet, Sensitive Treat!\\n\\nShangrila Zowie Wowie (tm) \"Sensitive/Responsive\" Smoka includes and is potentiated with the following non-irradiated, Mill-Stoned & Honed, exotica botanicals and botanical essences: Half-edged Lily-rare Bian Lian (lobeline factors), Kona Lactuca virosa, Yucatan Turnera aphrodisaca, Hawaiian Vervain (Maui strain), Siberian Leonorus Sibricus, rare Lotus Leaf, Jamaican Blue Verbena officinalis, Spanish Peumus Crocus Sativa, Chinese (flowering-tops only) Horny Goat Weed, Ginko Biloba, African Cola Vera, and African Wilde Dagga (flowering-tops only).

Prosaka botanical tablets were originally introduced as a botanical, supplemental alternative to various traditional medications that are prescribed for stress, anxiety, depressiveness, mood enhancement, insomnia, excessive dream activity, etc. We like to use this analogy: Imagine the circumstances of your life to be hurricane-ish. Certainly, Prosaka will not stop the wind from blowing. However, it will help to center you within the calm eye of your hurricane, so that you will better see your living and make your decisions from a calmer, more serene, more balanced perspective. Please note that when undertaking any supplemental herbal regimen in this arena, it is important to make a personal commitment to the therapy. It would make no sense to purchase Prosaka and to take it only sporadic!\\nally or only briefly. It is for this reason, although Prosaka is a very expensive formulation to produce; that we offer 300 count containers at as much of a reduced price as we are able to offer.\\n\\nProsaka is an exclusive, proprietary amalgamation in tablet form which includes the following uncommon botanicals, extracts, flower-top essences and essential oils: Radix Salviae, Sensitive Mimosa Bark, Arillus Euphoriae, Shizandra, Frutcus Mori, Caulis Polygoni, Zizyohus, Tang Kuei, Cedar Seed, Sweetflag Rhizome, Cuscutae, Amber, Radix Scutellariae, Evodia, Longan, Arisaema, Cistanches, Radix Polygalae, Red Sage Root and Eucommia. No factor contained within Prosaka is restricted or regulated by law. All botanicals contained within are non-irradiated and are of pharmaceutical grade. \\n\\nSuggested Usage: 1 - 2 tablets; 2 to 3 times per day as needed. Best taken on an empty stomach. (During times of intensity up to 10 tablets per day may be utilized.) \\n\\nAlso Note: Prosaka is not intended to supercede physician\\'s care nor is it intended for use during pregnancy.\\n\\n********************************************************\\nPROSAKA PRICING:\\n\\n* One 100 count bag ... $55.00 plus shipping\\n* One 300 count container ... $130.00 plus shipping\\nFor larger quantities, please inquire.\\n\\n(See Intro Offers at bottom of this text for further savings!)\\n\\n*******************************************\\n**AQUEOUS KATHMANDU (tm) (Happy Drops)**\\n*******************************************\\n\\n\"Personal Choice\" enhanced \"Sensitivity\" for non-smokers & tokers.\\n\\nAqueous Kathmandu has only been offered to market at large for a short while.

You won\\'t need luck, just keep reading. Don\\'t \\ndelete this!!! \\n------------------------------------------------------ \\nFirst read about how a 15 year old made $71,000. See below.... \\nAS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV: This is the media report. \\nPARENTS OF 15 - YEAR OLD - FIND $71,000 CASH HIDDEN \\nIN HIS CLOSET! \\nDoes this headline look familiar? Of course it does. \\nYou most likely have just seen this story recently \\nfeatured on a major nightly news program (USA). \\nAnd reported elsewhere in the world (including my neck \\nof the woods - New Zealand). His mother was cleaning \\nand putting laundry away when she came across a large \\nbrown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath \\nsome clothes and a skateboard in the back of her \\n15-year-old sons closet. \\nNothing could have prepared her for the shock she got \\nwhen she opened the bag and found it was full of cash. \\nFive-dollar bills, twenties, fifties and hundreds - \\nall neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles. \\n\"My first thought was that he had robbed a bank\", \\nsays the 41-year-old woman, \"There was over $71,000 \\ndollars in that bag -- that\\'s more than my husband \\nearns in a year\". \\nThe woman immediately called her husband at the \\ncar-dealership where he worked to tell him what she \\nhad discovered. He came home right away and they \\ndrove together to the boys school and picked him up. \\nLittle did they suspect that where the money came from \\nwas more shocking than actually finding it in \\nthe closet. \\nAs it turns out, the boy had been sending out, via \\nE-mail, a type of \"Report\" to E-mail addresses that he \\nobtained off the Internet. Everyday after school for \\nthe past 2 months, he had been doing this right on his \\ncomputer in his bedroom. \\n\"I just got the E-mail one day and I figured what the \\nheck, I put my name on it like the instructions said \\nand I started sending it out\", says the clever \\n15-year-old. \\nThe E-mail letter listed 5 addresses and contained \\ninstructions to send one $5 dollar bill to each person \\non the list, then delete the address at the top and \\nmove the others addresses down, and finally to add \\nyour name to the top of the list. \\nThe letter goes on to state that you would receive \\nseveral thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within 2 \\nweeks if you sent out the letter with your \\nname at the top of the 5-address list. \"I get junk \\nE-mail all the time, and really did not think it was \\ngoing to work\", the boy continues. \\nWithin the first few days of sending out the E-mail, \\nthe Post Office Box that his parents had gotten him \\nfor his video-game magazine subscriptions began to \\nfill up with not magazines, but envelopes containing \\n$5 bills. \\n\"About a week later I rode [my bike] down to the post \\noffice and my box had 1 magazine and about 300 \\nenvelops stuffed in it. There was also a yellow slip \\nthat said I had to go up to the [post office] counter. \\nI thought I was in trouble or something (laughs)\". He \\ngoes on, \"I went up to the counter and they had a \\nwhole box of more mail for me. I had to ride back \\nhome and empty out my backpack because I could not \\ncarry it all\". \\nOver the next few weeks, the boy continued sending \\nout the E-mail. \"The money just kept coming in and I \\njust kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet, \\nbarely had time for my homework\". He had also \\nbeen riding his bike to several of the banks in his \\narea and exchanging the $5 bills for twenties, fifties \\nand hundreds. \\n\"I didn\\'t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept \\nriding to different banks with like five thousand at a \\ntime in my backpack. I would usually tell the lady at \\nthe bank counter that my dad had sent me in to \\nexchange the money and he was outside waiting for me. \\nOne time the lady gave me a really strange look and \\ntold me that she would not be able to do it for me and \\nmy dad would have to come in and do it, but I just \\nrode to the next bank down the street (laughs).\" \\nSurprisingly, the boy did not have any reason to be \\nafraid. The reporting news team examined and \\ninvestigated the so-called \"chain-letter\" the boy was \\nsending out and found that it was not a chain-letter \\nat all. In fact, it was completely legal according to \\nUS Postal and Lottery Laws, Title 18, Section 1302 and \\n1341, or Title 18, Section 3005 in the US code, also \\nin the code of federal regulations, Volume 16, \\nSections 255 and 436, which state a product or service \\nmust be exchanged for money received. \\nEvery five-dollar bill that he received contained a \\nlittle note that read, \"Please send me report number \\nXYX\".This simple note made the letter legal because he \\nwas exchanging a service (A Report on how-to) for a \\nfive-dollar fee. \\n[This is the end of the media release. If you would \\nlike to understand how the system works and get your \\n$71,000 - please continue reading. What appears below \\nis what the 15 year old was sending out on the net - \\nYOU CAN USE IT TOO - just follow the simple \\ninstructions]. \\nTHANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET ! \\n================================================== \\nYou will Make over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your \\nhome!! \\nBefore you say \\'\\'Bull\\'\\', please read the following. This is the \\nletter you have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the \\npopularity of this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news \\nprogram \\nrecently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program \\ndescribed below, to see if it really can make people money. The show \\nalso \\ninvestigated whether or not the program was legal. \\nTheir findings proved once and for all that there are \\'\\'absolutely NO \\nLaws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow \\nthe simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only \\n$25 out of pocket cost\\'\\'. \\nDUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS \\nPROGRAM HAS \\nATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER. \\nThis is what one had to say: \\'\\' Thanks to this profitable opportunity. \\nI was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am so \\nglad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for \\nthe minimal effort and money required. To my astonishment, I received \\ntotal \\n$610,470.00 in 21 weeks, with money still coming in\\'\\'. \\nPam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey. \\n=========================================================\\n=======Here is \\nanother testimonial: \\'\\'\\' this program has been around for a \\nlong time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this \\nagain in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the \\nsimple instructions and wallaa ..... 3 weeks later the money started to \\ncome \\nin. First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that \\nmade a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering \\nthe \\nprogram, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The \\nkey to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change \\nanything.\\'\\' More testimonials later but first: \\n===== PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE ======== \\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\\n$$$$$$$$ \\nIf you would like to make at least $500,000 every 4 to 5 months easily \\nand comfortably, please read the following...THEN READ IT AGAIN and \\nAGAIN!!! \\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$\\n$$$$$$$$ \\nFOLLOW THE SIMPLE INSTRUCTION BELOW AND YOUR FINANCIAL \\nDREAMS WILL COME \\nTRUE, GUARANTEED! \\nINSTRUCTIONS: \\n================Order all 5 reports shown on the list below \\n================= \\nFor each report, send $5 CASH, THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT \\nYOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose \\nname appears ON THAT LIST next to the report. MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN \\nADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE TOP LEFT CORNER in case of any mail \\nproblems. \\n=== When you place your order, make sure you order each of the 5 \\nreports. \\nYou will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer \\nand resell them. YOUR TOTAL COST $5 X 5=$25.00. \\nWithin a few days you will receive, via e-mail, each of the 5 reports \\nfrom these 5 different individuals. Save them on your computer so they will \\nbe accessible for you to send to the 1,000\\'s of people who will order them \\nfrom you. Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk \\nin case something happens to your computer. \\nIMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed \\nnext to each report, or their sequence on the list, in any way other \\nthan what is instructed below in step \\'\\' 1 through 6 \\'\\' or you will \\nloose out on majority of your profits. Once you understand the way this \\nworks, you will also see how it does not work if you change it. Remember, \\nthis \\nmethod has been tested, and if you alter, it will NOT work !!! People \\nhave tried to put their friends/relatives names on all five thinking they \\ncould get all the money. But it does not work this way. Believe us, we all \\nhave tried to be greedy and then nothing happened. So Do Not try to change \\nanything other than what is instructed. Because if you do, it will not \\nwork for you. \\nRemember, honesty reaps the reward!!! \\n1.... After you have ordered all 5 reports, take this advertisement \\nand REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT #5. \\nThis person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting \\ntheir fortune. \\n2.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 4 down TO REPORT # 5. \\n3.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 3 down TO REPORT # 4. \\n4.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 2 down TO REPORT # 3. \\n5.... Move the name & address in REPORT # 1 down TO REPORT # 2 \\n6.... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # 1 Position. \\nPLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY! \\n=========================================================\\n======= \\n**** Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it \\non your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES. \\nSave this on a disk as well just in case you loose any data. To assist \\nyou with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you \\npurchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which \\nincludes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of \\nfree \\nclassified ads and much more. There are 2 Primary methods to get this \\nventure going: \\nMETHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY \\n=========================================================\\n======= \\nLet\\'s say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and \\nwe will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. \\nLet\\'s also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the \\nresponse \\ncould be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many \\npeople will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 \\neach).Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. \\nWith a 0.2% response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1 \\nThose 10 people responded by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total \\nof 50,000. \\nOut of those 50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That\\'s=100 \\npeople responded and ordered Report # 2. \\nThose 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500,000 \\ne-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3. \\nThose 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 \\nmillion e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders \\nfor Report! # 4. Whose 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a \\ntotal of \\n50,000,000 (50 million) e-mails. The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 \\norders for \\nReport # 5 THAT\\'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half \\nmillion). \\nYour total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 \\n+ 3.....$5,000 + 4..... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand \\nTotal=$555,550.00 \\nNUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE \\nWORST POSSIBLERESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU \\nCALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL \\nMAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! \\n=========================================================\\n======= \\nREMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE ORDERING \\nOUT \\nOF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO. Dare to think for a moment what would happen if \\neveryone or half or even one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails \\neach or more? There are over 150 million people on the Internet worldwide \\nand counting. Believe me, many people will do just that, and more! \\nMETHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET \\n=========================================================\\n======= \\nAdvertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are \\nhundreds of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the \\nInternet will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you \\nstart with Method # 1and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you \\nreceive, all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That\\'s \\nit. Always provide \\nsame day service on all orders. \\nThis will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your \\nname and address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise \\nuntil they receive the report. \\n===================AVAILABLE REPORTS \\n========================== \\nORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY. Notes: Always \\nsend \\n$5 cash (U.S. CURRENCY) for each Report. Checks NOT accepted. Make sure \\nthe cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper. On \\none of those sheets of paper, Write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you \\nare ordering, \\nYOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address. \\nPLACE YOUR ORDER FOR THESE REPORTS NOW : \\n=========================================================\\n======= \\nREPORT #1 \"The Insider\\'s Guide to Advertising for Free on the Net\" \\nOrder Report #1 from: \\nK.Palludan \\n9550 Summersweet Ct. \\nLas Vegas, Nevada 89123 \\nUSA \\n________________________________________________________________\\n______ \\nREPORT #2 \"\\'The insider\\'s Guide to Sending Bulk e-mail on the Net\\' \\nOrder Report #2 from: \\nKris Estes \\n3055 Casey Drive #203 \\nLas Vegas, Nevada 89120 \\n________________________________________________________________\\n______ \\nREPORT #3 \"\\'Secret to Multilevel Marketing on the Net\" \\nOrder Report #3 from : \\nP.

Lasley \\n4230 Edgewood Circle \\nIdaho Falls, Idaho 83406 \\nUSA \\n________________________________________________________________\\n_____ \\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ YOUR SUCCESS GUIDELINES \\n$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ \\nFollow these guidelines to guarantee your success: \\n=== If you do not receive at least 10 orders for Report #1 within 2 \\nweeks, continue sending e-mails until you do. \\n=== After you have received 10 orders, 2 to 3 weeks after that you \\nshould receive 100 orders or more for REPORT # 2. If you did not, continue \\nadvertising or sending e-mails until you do. \\n=== Once you have received 100 or more orders for Report # 2, YOU CAN \\nRELAX, because the system is already working for you, and the cash will \\ncontinue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER: Every time your \\nname \\nis moved down on the list, you are placed in front of a Different report. \\nYou can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report \\npeople are ordering from you. IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME \\nSEND \\nANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS \\nAGAIN. There is NO \\nLIMIT to the income you can generate from this business !!! \\n=========================================================\\n======= \\nFOLLOWING IS A NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM: \\nYou have just received information that can give you financial freedom \\nfor the rest of your life, with NO RISK and JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT. \\nYou can make more money in the next few weeks and months than you have \\never imagined.

It works exceedingly well as it is now. \\nRemember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put \\nyour name and address in Report #1 and moved others to #2 ...........# 5 \\nas \\ninstructed above. One of the people you send this to may send out \\n100,000 or more e-mails and your name will be on every one of them. \\nRemember \\nthough, the more you send out the more potential customers! you will \\nreach.

IT IS UP TO YOU NOW ! \\n====================== MORE \\nTESTIMONIALS====================== \\n\\'\\' My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an \\naccountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good \\nmoney. When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving \\n\\'\\'junk mail\\'\\'. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of \\nthe population and percentages involved. I \\'\\'knew\\'\\' it wouldn\\'t work. Jody \\ntotally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in \\nwith \\nboth feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old \\n\\'\\'I told you so\\'\\' on her when the thing didn\\'t work. Well, the laugh was \\non me! \\nWithin 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days she \\nhad \\nreceived total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. ! I have \\njoined \\nJody in her \\'\\'hobby\\'\\'. \\nMitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois \\n=========================================================\\n======= \\'\\' Not \\nbeing the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my \\nmind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided \\nthat the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that \\nI \\nwouldn\\'t get enough orders to at least get my money back\\'\\'. \\'\\' I was \\nsurprised \\nwhen I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders. I made \\n$319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about this deal is \\nthat it does not matter where people live. There simply isn\\'t a better \\ninvestment \\nwith a faster return and so big\\'\\'. \\nDan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada \\n=========================================================\\n======= \\'\\' I had \\nreceived this program before. I deleted it, but later I \\nwondered if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who \\nto contact ! to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed \\nagain by someone else.........11 months passed then it luckily came \\nagain.....I did not delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my \\nfirst try and all the money came within 22 weeks\\'\\'. \\nSusan De Suza, New York, N.Y. \\n=========================================================\\n====== \\n\\'\\' It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with \\nlittle cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and \\nwithin 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made \\n$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was $ \\n362,840.00.

The issue I\\'ve been having is that not every everyone deals with the properties I\\'m looking for.

But for what ever reason, the houses just don\\'t sell.\\n\\nI need those houses...\\n\\nMost of the agents I\\'ve dealt with were hesitant because there isn\\'t much of a return for what time and effort you invest. However, the private investors I work with use \"unconventional\" private funding so we both can avoid long drawn out loan approvals. In fact most cases we just pay cash and close in a week. I am pre-qualified with Greentree Funding for up to $900,000 for a purchase money mortgage based on a non-owner occupied loan at 90% LTV.  (And of course you get your full commission.) \\n\\nI\\'m not a licensed real estate agent nor am I affiliated with any real estate firm, which means I can work with you just about any way you want. Please don\\'t be under the impression that we have to pay under market value to be interested. Sometimes I can even pay retail price. The only guarantee I\\'ll make is that I will not waste your time, and in most cases I can tell you over the phone whether I\\'m interested or not. \\n\\nIf you are looking to purchace a project home from our inventory or would like information on forming an alliance with  Synteligent Properties, please contact me @ 847.366.4300 or email me @ jeremy@synteligent.com \\n\\nBest Wishes, \\nJeremy Lessaris\\n\\n\\n847.366.4300\\nwww.synteligent.com\\njeremy@synteligent.com\\n\\n\\nTo Unsubscribe: send mail to majordomo@FreeBSD.org\\nwith \"unsubscribe freebsd-ports\" in the body of the message\\n\\n'),\n",
